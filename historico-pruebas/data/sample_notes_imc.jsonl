{"patient_id": "67927", "patient": "A 72-year-old, cachectic (height 170 cm, weight 50 kg, BMI 17.3 kg/m2) Caucasian man with COPD and a history of smoking had increasing shortness of breath. Pulmonary function testing performed 9 years prior showed a decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) [38% of predicted, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 3], which did not increase after albuterol inhalation. The high total lung capacity and residual volume were consistent with emphysema. On arrival of the emergency medical team at his home, our patient was dyspneic but alert. His vital signs were: blood pressure 150/100 mmHg, heart rate 103 bpm, and SpO2 81%. High-flow O2 was supplied at 10 L/min. using a non-rebreathing mask with an O2 reservoir bag (Fig. ). The SpO2 increased to 99% within 20 minutes, and our patient was transported to the emergency department. As it was unknown whether our patient had a hypoxic respiratory drive, O2 flow was erroneously limited to 4 L/min. He got increasingly irritated, had no headache, but was no longer oriented to time, place, and person, and became unconscious, gasping for air 2 hours later. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, and the heart rate was 80 bpm. Breath sounds were distant, and his tongue was cyanotic. An arterial blood gas analysis taken shortly after starting bag-valve-mask ventilation showed marked hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis (Table ). Noninvasive ventilation was not a possible option []. Our patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and received albuterol and ipratropium bromide by inhalation. Methylprednisolone, amoxicillin clavulante plus clarithromycin (for an infiltrate in the right paracardiac region), and low-dose theophylline were administered intravenously. Four hours later, our patient was extubated (Table ), and was later transferred to a medical ward. The high PaCO2 was explained by low tidal volumes and a probably hypoxic ventilatory drive (Table ). Because of our patient’s worsening dyspnea, he mistakenly received O2 at 2 L/min. by the same non-rebreathing mask (Fig. ). After a few hours, intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required due to hypotension (75/50 mmHg) and bradypnea (Table ). He was re-intubated and mechanically ventilated for 24 hours. Norepinephrine was given to stabilize the blood pressure. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block and right ventricular hypertrophy, and the echocardiography documented a chronic cor pulmonale with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Respiratory acidosis improved, and the patient was temporarily extubated (Table ). However, aspiration of a pea (removed by bronchoscopy, Fig. ) with atelectasis of the right lung again necessitated mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy. One month after admission, the exhausted patient died of CO2 narcosis (Table ). An autopsy was not performed."}
{"patient_id": "87441", "patient": "Ten-year-old Japanese boy with past medical history of Hemoglobin Evans [alpha2 62(E11) Val→Met] and asymptomatic gallbladder stones was admitted for epigastric abdominal pain. He had reported nothing out of the ordinary until the day before admission, when he experienced acute-onset abdominal pain and emesis. The pain subsided spontaneously after several hours, but recurred soon after breakfast the next morning. The pain was continuously located in the epigastric region. The patient described the pain as 8 on a scale of 0–10, with 10 indicating the severest pain. A review of systems showed the patient positive for general malaise, nonbiliary vomiting, and conjunctiva which are slightly more yellowish than his usual state. There was no fever, back pain, altered mental status, or chest pain.\\nHis past medical history was significant for a heterozygous in-frame mutation of Hemoglobin Evans [alpha2 62(E11) Val→Met]. He had been followed up by a pediatric hematologist for resultant mild hemolytic anemia and indirect-bilirubin-dominant jaundice (total bilirubin 4–6 mg/dL), but was otherwise healthy with normal motor and cognitive development. When he was 8-years old, aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection occurred. At that time, an abdominal ultrasonography revealed asymptomatic gallbladder stones. He took daily folic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. Both his mother and his brother carried the same heterozygous mutation.\\nOn examination, the patient was not in acute distress. His height was 133 cm and his weight was 30.5 kg. He was afebrile, his heart rate was 62 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, and his extremities were warm. The skin and conjunctiva were icteric. The abdomen was soft and flat without guarding. He reported epigastric tenderness on palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Murphy's sign was negative.\\nLaboratory studies revealed marked hyperbillirubinemia and elevated liver and biliary function, with T-Bil of 13.9 mg/dL, D-Bil of 4.5 mg/dL, AST 371 U/L, ALT 438 U/L, LDH 419 U/L, ALP 929 U/L, and g-GT 71 U/L. There was no leukocytosis (WBC 7950/μL), or any elevation of serum amylase (Amy 58 U/L). Normocytic anemia and reticulocytosis (Hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, MCV 95.6 fL, reticulocyte 12.7%) were unchanged from his previous visit. An abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan were conducted in order to determine the cause of the obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography revealed a dilated common bile duct (3.6 mm in diameter), but failed to reveal the cause of the obstruction. The CT scan showed multiple, radiopaque shadows in the lower common bile duct as well as in the gallbladder. The pancreatic duct was not dilated.\\nThe diagnosis of choledocholithiases and obstructive jaundice was made. Once oral intake was stopped, the abdominal tenderness disappeared quickly. The jaundice worsened, however, over the next 4 days and reached T-bil/D-Bil of 25.6/14.2 mg/dL, respectively. A refractory, itchy irritation of the skin developed. We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on 6th day of hospitalization. Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation, followed by stone removal procedure using a basket and an extractor balloon resulted in extraction of a small bilirubin stone to the duodenum. Although cholangiography after the stone removal revealed no definite residual stones, a biliary stent (Flexima™ biliary stent system, 7 Fr, 5 cm; Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was placed in order to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Jaundice and general malaise subsided after the procedure. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiography were performed 10 days after the ERCP. Intraoperative cholangiography revealed a new choledocholithiasis adjacent to the patent biliary stent placed during the first ERCP. Attempts to remove the stone failed. The gallbladder contained many black pigment stones of several millimeters in size. He was discharged without symptoms.\\nThe remaining bilirubin choledocholithiasis was removed during the second ERCP, performed 4 months after the cholecystectomy. Although cholangiography after stone retrieval showed no evidence of remaining biliary stones, a biliary stent was kept in place for 2 more months to prevent any possible biliary obstruction, and was finally removed 2 months after the second ERCP. The symptoms have not recurred to date."}
{"patient_id": "75470", "patient": "A 25-year-old man presented with pain in both knees for four consecutive years and, since 3 months, bilateral groin pain and pain in the gluteal region, radiating to both knees.\\nThe patient has been diagnosed with HHR as a child and has been on potassium phosphate and calcitriol tablets ever since. A typical bowing and anteromedial rotation of the tibia was corrected with tibial shaft osteotomies and Ilizarov fixators of both tibias about 10 years ago []. After these procedures, very slow healing of the bone with multiple revisions due to delayed union was observed.\\nThe patient has had pain in both knees for four years, more in the right than in the left knee. Initially, at 6 years of follow-up, approximately 4 years ago, MRI of both knees and pelvic X-ray did not reveal any pathological changes other than a strong coxa vara malformation of both hips (). Pain was described by the patient as start-up pain that disappeared or bettered after walking with full weight bearing for a while. Since about 3 months, the pain began to concentrate on both hips radiating in both knees; the same start-up character of the pain was described. Upon questioning, the patient admitted that he has not been taking his medication regularly the last 6 months.\\nClinical examination revealed a patient with athletic build, weighting 53 kg and measuring 155 cm. Hip range of motion was (right side/left side) flexion/extension 120/0/0 and 130/0/0, endo-/exorotation 20/0/5 and 20/0/30, and ab-/adduction 10/0/30 and 15/0/30. Trendelenburg's sign was positive on both sides. The patient complained of pain by abduction and exorotation. The Harris and Oxford hip scores were 86 and 43, respectively. Haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal range except for a low phosphate of 1.7 mg/dL (norm: 2.3–4.7) and low potassium of 3.1 mmol/L (norm: 3.5–5.1). Radiographs of hips and pelvis () revealed fractures in both femoral necks. An MRI of the pelvis showed an atrophic nonunion of both fractures ().\\nTreatment options were discussed with the patient and a conservative treatment was decided on. The patient was advised to participate in sports that did not involve shock loading of the hip joint, for example, swimming, cycling, and aquajogging. The patient was informed that a prosthetic replacement of the hip could become necessary by further increase of symptoms or necrosis of the femoral head."}
{"patient_id": "15297", "patient": "The patient was a 32-year-old male ex-smoker. He was diagnosed as MFS at the age of 26 based on an aortic dissection (Stanford type A), aortic regurgitation and marfanoid habitus. A Bentall operation with an artificial valve replacement for aortic dissection and a regurgitation of the aortic valve was performed. Thereafter, he was required to take warfarin for the artificial heart valve and was followed at a local hospital. His adherence to medication was poor, which went unnoticed, resulting in the dose of warfarin gradually being increased to 6.5 mg per day in 2017, when he was admitted to the emergency unit of our hospital suffering from a massive haemoptysis and dyspnoea.\\nThe patient had a history of left pneumothorax at the age of 16; however, the details of this are unknown since his mother died in his childhood and the father has been missing since then. On presentation, the patient was fully conscious with a height of 198 cm, body weight of 77 kg, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 bpm, body temperature of 36.9 °C, and a saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO2) of 94% in room air. The physical examination revealed coarse crackles on auscultation, especially in the right upper lung areas. He had characteristic features such as a tall height, arachnodactyly, dolichocephaly and retrognathia, which are compatible with MFS.\\nLaboratory data demonstrated anaemia (blood haemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL), an elevated white blood cell count (12,300 /μL), a prothrombin time of 32.5 s (international normalized ratio PT-INR: 5.21), and an active partial thromboplastin time of 61.2 s. Serum tumour markers, antibodies of connective tissue disease and markers of infection such as Aspergillus and Mycobacterium were all negative. Pathological bacteria were not detected in sputum culture. A chest X-ray showed a right apical pulmonary cyst with an air-fluid level inside and consolidation in the right lower lung field (Fig. b). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated multiple cystic lesions in the upper lobes (Fig. b) and a maximum intensity projection (MIP) detected an abnormal vessel originating from the right subclavian artery, which extended into the cyst (Fig. ).\\nAn emergency bronchoscopy revealed continuous bleeding from the apical segmental bronchus of the right lung (B1) (Fig. ), which appeared to have been stopped by topical application of epinephrine and thrombin. Vitamin K and haemostatic medications were infused, which was followed by a transfusion of four units of blood. After emergent therapy, the patient was transferred to the cardiovascular unit of another hospital. An angiography was performed and the abnormal vessel was radiographically diagnosed as the LTA (Fig. a, b). Moreover, the bleeding was stopped successfully by embolization of the artery, which confirmed that the abnormal vessel responsible for bleeding was the LTA. The patient’s condition improved, and warfarin was restarted with strict control of PT-INR. The patient has since been stable with no signs of re-bleeding."}

On general examination, the pulse rate was 98 per min, regular with blood pressure of 110/84 mmHg. On auscultation, S2 was single with ejection systolic murmur Grade III/IV. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe calcific aortic valve (annulus 26 mm) with peak systolic gradient of 72 mmHg and mean of 43 mmHg, mild aortic regurgitation, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 55% ejection fraction, and mild mitral regurgitation. Aortic angiography showed fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta and arch of aorta to the origin of the left subclavian artery []. Carotid Doppler showed normal bilateral carotids with no significant block or atheroma. In preanesthetic assessment, all laboratory investigations were normal, blood pressure was 112/86 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats/min. He was accepted in the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Grade IV under General Anaesthesia for Bentall debranching procedure.\\nPreinduction monitoring included electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, bispectral index, and invasive blood pressure in the right radial and left femoral arteries. NIRS technique was used to measure cerebral oximetry. Two disposable SomaSensor transducers (Invos 5100C, Covidien, USA) capable of producing and detecting optical data from the patient were applied to the left and right sides of the patients’ forehead. Femoral vein and femoral artery were dissected for emergency femorofemoral bypass. After induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed using two-dimensional TEE probe to confirm the diagnosis and to detect any additional findings. No plaque was noted in ascending aorta, arch, and descending aorta in TEE. After heparinization, CPB was commenced using high aortic and two-stage right atrial venous cannulation. After replacing the aortic valve and suturing the proximal end of the tube graft, cannulas were placed separately for the right and left carotid artery for antegrade cerebral perfusion. The distal end of the aortic arch and the left subclavian artery was sutured under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) at 20°C. During DHCA, the antegrade cerebral perfusion through the right and left carotid artery was continued at a rate of 800–1000 ml/min. The institutional protocol for brain protection during DHCA was followed which also included external brain cooling, pharmacological protection in the form of injection thiopentone 3 mg/kg during cooling and rewarming, injection phenytoin sodium 15 mg/kg, injection methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, and injection lignocaine 2 mg/kg. Total bypass time was 330 min, aortic cross-clamp time of 243 min and DHCA time of 37 min. Monitored parameters (invasive blood pressure mean, cerebral NIRS, temperature, and bispectral index [BIS]) in operation room and intensive care unit are shown in . NIRS values were 72.9 ± 4 and 64.8 ± 4.9 for the left and right hemisphere, respectively. The values never changed more than 11% throughout the procedure.\\nThe patient developed the right hemiparesis postoperative, confirmed with noncontrast computerized tomography head/magnetic resonance imaging which revealed the left middle cerebral artery territory stroke which was embolic []. He was managed conservatively and started recovering with supportive care. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks with right hemiparesis."}
{"patient_id": "162984", "patient": "A 19-year-old male (height, 145 cm; weight, 34 kg), who was treated for cerebral palsy and refractory epilepsy due to lissencephaly, visited our hospital (Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea) because of severe abdominal distension and vomiting. Also, this patient was not able to perform independent daily living without any assistance because of mental disability. The patient had been treated with an anti-epileptic agent such as lamotrigine, phenobarbital, leviteracetam, rivotril, and ativan for epilepsy since he was a neonate and had visited our hospital several times for rectal decompression because of chronic constipation. The patient, suffered from chronic constipation over 3 years, had history of ≤2 bowel movements per week with hard large stool, necessitating rectal stimulation for defecation. Two months prior to admission, the patient had experienced a 3.0 kg weight loss and sleep disturbance with irritability.\\nUpon admission, the patient was lethargic with dried lips. Abdominal examination showed epigastric and lower abdominal distension with decreased bowel sounds, which had mild rigidity. We could not check the site of pain and tenderness due to impaired communication with the patient. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 45,690/µL, increased C-reactive protein at 15.14 mg/dL (reference range <0.5 mg/dL), and increased blood urea nitrogen/creatinine at 33.15/1.91 mg/dL. The patient had an electrolyte imbalance consisting of hyponatremia (124 mmol/L Na+) and hyperkalemia (5.9 mmol/L K+). Intravenous antibiotics of 3rd cephalosporin (50 mg/kg/day) and metronidazole (15 mg/kg/day) were administrated.\\nAn initial abdominal x-ray showed a markedly distended stomach and a huge quantity of gas in right lower abdomen (). We performed continuous suction with a naso-gastric and rectal tube for decompression and observed the patient. The next day, abdominal distension progressively deteriorated and a follow-up laboratory examination revealed uncontrolled inflammation. A follow-up supine abdominal x-ray 24 hours after the decompression revealed fixed haustral gas formation despite decompression with gastric and rectal tube insertion (). Leukocytosis was improved, but C-reactive protein levels increased markedly to 34.11 mg/dL. An abdominal computed tomography scan without contrast enhancement scan showed dilated small bowel in the abdomen but no 'while' or 'bird peak' sign ().\\nWe suspected intestinal obstruction as the primary cause of the symptoms and planned an explorative laparotomy. During the laparotomy, ischemic changes were seen throughout the cecum and part of the ascending colon. The cecum, which was not fixed at the retro-peritoneum, was dilated and twisted around the terminal ileum () and an approximately 20 cm length segmentectomy of the proximal ascending colon was completed with preserved ileocecal valve.\\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and hospital ward for >2 months due to post-operative ileus. Approximately 3 months after the laparotomy, previous ileus signs had nearly disappeared and the patient's symptoms were much improved."}

He then became severely agitated with the main complaints of sleepiness, dysphagia, limb weakness, and respiratory and circulatory failure. The patient unfortunately died soon thereafter.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with subacute ptosis at 12-years-old.\\nThe patient was delivered vaginally at term with a birth weight of 3250 g and without developmental delay. His height was 156 cm and weight was 50 kg upon admission to the hospital. The patient's mother exhibited no abnormal symptoms after the birth. The family history of the patient regarding a similar condition was negative.\\nClinical examination showed that the patient presented with pyramidal signs and very easily elicited reflexes and extensor toe signs on both feet.\\nThe routine blood and urine tests, urinary sediment examination, routine fecal tests, and occult blood test were performed, which all showed normal results. The arterial blood gas was tested and the pH value was 7.32. The oxygen pressure was 11.3 kPa, the carbon dioxide pressure was 4.9 kPa, and the oxygen saturation was 99%. The arterial plasma lactate level was slightly elevated to 3 mg/dL. Ammonia and blood sugar levels were normal. Other blood biochemistry indexes were also normal. The cytological and biochemical examination showed the normal presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-positive antibodies to acetylcholine, presynaptic membrane receptor, and thymoma in the blood, and positive oligoclonal bands in the CSF. The antibody tests to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Gene sequencing analysis revealed a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 9176 of the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene (Leu to Pro) in the patient and a heteroplasmic mutation in the patient’s mother (Figure ).\\nElectroencephalogram analysis revealed slow-waves of background activity. The brain MRI scan showed symmetrical abnormal signals in the basal ganglia, medial thalami, periaqueductal region of the midbrain and pons, and the bilateral white matter around the lateral ventricles (Figure )."}
{"patient_id": "121729", "patient": "A 25-year-old man was scheduled to undergo laminectomy and decompression because of progressive quadriplegia. The patient exhibited no abnormality during prenatal growth. At the age of 1 year, CLS was suspected based on his facial features, such as a broad nose and thick everted lips, and he was diagnosed with CLS via genetic analysis at the age of 3 years. At the age of 14 years, the patient gradually developed quadriplegia because of cervical cord compression induced by the forward shift of the atlas and calcification of the yellow ligament, and he experienced difficulty in walking. The patient underwent laminectomy of the 1st–7th cervical vertebrae under general anesthesia at the age of 15 years[; however, laminectomy did not resolve his symptoms consistently, that is, his symptoms relapsed and remitted.\\nAt the age of 24 years, the patient could no longer maintain a standing position without assistance. He was scheduled for laminectomy because of exacerbation due to recalcification of the yellow ligament.\\nDuring preoperative examination, the patient exhibited puffy tapered fingers, a broad nose, and thick everted lips, which are characteristic of CLS (Fig. ) and severe obesity (height, 145 cm; weight, 80 kg; BMI, 38 kg/m2). Cardiac comorbidities such as anomaly or valvular disease and respiratory comorbidities such as respiratory dysfunction caused by skeletal abnormality were not found. Computed tomography (CT) revealed calcification of the yellow ligament, macroglossia, upper airway narrowing, and short thyromental distance (TMD; 40 mm) and sternomental distance (SMD; 118 mm) (Fig. ). The patient snored while sleeping, and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) was suspected. Airway assessments could not be performed because the patient struggled to follow instructions because of mental retardation. We noted that the following comment was made in the patient's anesthetic record at the age of 15 years: “Difficult mask ventilation. Two-person mask ventilation was required. Cormack grade III with Macintosh laryngoscope. Easy intubation with Airwayscope (AWS).”\\nBased on these findings and information, we expected difficulty with mask ventilation and intubation as well as awake intubation because of mental retardation. Therefore, we planned bronchofiberscope-guided nasotracheal intubation, maintaining spontaneous breathing under moderate sedation with propofol.\\nThe patient's blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 98% when he entered the operation room, and the value increased to 100% under 10 L/min O2 flow using a mask before anesthesia induction. After 60 mg of lidocaine was administered to prevent propofol injection pain,[ sedation was initiated via target-controlled infusion (TCI) of 1.5 μg/ml propofol. We could successfully maintain the patient's spontaneous breathing and reach sedation while gradually decreasing his consciousness level. After confirmation that SpO2 was maintained at 100%, a basic tracheal tube (internal diameter, 7.0 mm) was inserted through his right nostril and the bronchofiberscope was inserted through the tracheal tube. The vocal folds were easily found, and bronchofiberscope-guided intubation was performed. Spontaneous breathing was maintained during these processes. After appropriate intubation into the trachea was confirmed using a capnometer, 50 mg propofol and 50 mg rocuronium were additionally administered. These processes were smoothly performed. As O2 was inhaled through the mask during bronchofiberscope-guided intubation, SpO2 was maintained at >98%. After intubation, the upper airway and larynx were observed using AWS. In general, a regular-sized intlock would be applied for this procedure. However, in this case, a thin intlock was needed because of large tongue and narrow airway. His epiglottis and vocal folds were confirmed. Anesthesia was maintained using propofol (TCI, 2.5–3.5 μg/mL) and remifentanil (0.1–0.3 μg/kg/min). The surgery was performed without any complications. The duration of surgery was 315 minutes and that of anesthesia was 455 minutes. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) under intubation to keep the surgical wound at rest.\\nThe patient was managed under sedation and analgesia with propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl in the ICU. On postoperative day (POD) 4, awakening and extubation were planned. We considered the possibility of reintubation due to obstruction or aspiration because his oral secretion increased as he awoke; therefore, we extubated the patient by inserting a tube exchanger into the trachea. He neither struggled nor disliked the tube exchanger. However, as we suspected, SpO2 decreased to 90% because he could not discharge oral secretion by himself. Assist ventilation was performed, but it was inadequate. Although assisted ventilation became possible after insertion of a nasal airway and SpO2 improved to 99%, we decided to reintubate because of the accumulation of CO2 (PaCO2, 55.4 mmHg). Reintubation was performed using a GlideScope under tube exchanger guidance. On POD 8, tracheotomy was performed. After tracheotomy, weaning from mechanical ventilation was smoothly performed, and ventilation was discontinued on POD 11. The patient was discharged from the ICU on POD 14. On POD 21, deglutition training was started, and aspiration was gradually decreased. The tracheotomy aperture was gradually closed spontaneously and completely closed on POD 26. He was discharged to his home on POD 55."}
{"patient_id": "46197", "patient": "A 56-year-old male known to have IGHDIA was referred to our adult endocrinology unit after several years of lapsed follow-up. He was diagnosed in early childhood with severe growth retardation (−5.7 s.d. at 2 years of age). His case was included in pediatric publications as he belonged to the first group of children having the syndrome when it was first described . He was born from nonconsanguineous progenitors and any other family member was not of short stature. Birth length at 42 weeks of gestation was already poor (48 cm) and weight was 4080 g. In infancy, he was of proportionate short stature with certain phenotypic features such as puppet-face appearance. We are not aware of hypoglycemic episodes or micropenis in childhood and he had no problems related to dentition or puberty. Other pituitary hormonal axis functions were normal, and initial pituitary image did not reveal major abnormalities. Genetic study revealed a severe GH1 gene deletion of 6.7 kb in homozygous state. At the age of 7 years, with a −6 s.d. growth delay, he was given GH extracted from human pituitaries based on the Raben method in Zürich Children Hospital (Switzerland) for a couple of years, but no significant increase in growth was achieved (−6.2 s.d. at 9 years of age), compatible with the development of anti-GH Abs. Thus, his final height was poor, reaching only 123 cm, representing a SDS of −8.46 with respect to the Spanish population. Of interest is the fact that he leads a normal life, runs a bar, is married, and has two sons (carriers of 6.7 kb deletions without any clinical expression). He has been a heavy smoker for the last 30 years. Now in his fifties, he presents with health complaints that resembles those of adult GHD. He suffers from asthenia, osteomuscular pain, and osteoporosis.\\nOn physical examination (), apart from severe short stature, he was found to weigh 38 kg (BMI 24.71), with waist circumference being 85.5 cm, hip circumference 83 cm, and blood pressure 137/71 mmHg. He did not have any sign of hypogonadism. Genitals were normal with a testicular size of 20 ml bilaterally. He had a high-pitched voice."}

He had periodic sharp excruciating pain on the left side of his face radiating from the back of his left eyeball. Lacrimation, conjunctival congestion, and nasal discharge were present on the left side. The present cluster was started one day ago. He experienced two severe episodes the day before; each lasted about 60 minutes with a six-hour pain relief between them. On the day of admission, he came with the same severe hemifacial pain initiated less than five minutes ago (he worked in the same hospital that researchers practiced). He was otherwise healthy and had no past medical history except some orthopaedic surgeries (due to an accident). He was not an alcohol or drug abuser. He had the same abrupt pain every three to six months that lasted about 15 days (the shortest and the longest clusters he remembered were five and 17 days, respectively). His symptoms started since five years ago and each year he experienced two to four clusters of headache on average, albeit he remembered a year with only a seven-day episode. The pain was not always completely improved with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and very often, he was admitted to the hospital to receive oxygen therapy and intravenous painkillers. He mentioned that his first headache lasted six hours without any medication, as he was reluctant to receive any medication at first; however, he took painkillers for his following headaches. By taking medication, disabling episode of headaches lasted between 15 to 180 minutes; however, some mild to moderate pain remained for the same episode or following days of that cluster for which, he received trivial medication. He noted that he took just few hours sick leave and usually tolerated the pain. Once he received opioid (20 mg of intravenous meperidine) for his pain; however, it just added dizziness and nausea with no pain relief. He was reluctant to receive any prophylactic medication for his headaches. In his recent episode, he was admitted and hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring was utilized. Intravenous line was prepared and fluid was infused. He did not receive any supplemental oxygen. He received 20 mg of propofol (propofol 1% MCT/LCT, Fresenius, Germany) every four minutes () and simultaneous titrated dose of alfentanil (100 μg) every ten minutes. After the third injection of propofol and second prescription of alfentanil (about 15 minutes from the initiation of therapy), he reported acceptable pain relief with a mild remaining pain. He received a total dose of 120 mg of propofol (with the same protocol, however, as we encountered some drowsiness with no desaturation, we extended the interval for injection to every ten minutes and overall, it took about 50 minutes). Moreover, a total of 500 μg of alfentanil was infused (about 50 minutes). At this time he reported complete recovery with no remaining pain. He was just monitored and was discharged after two hours with no medication. He had no more episodes in the following days. In a four-month follow up, he did not experience any cluster headache."}

Routine spinal operation with radicular decompression of right L5 and S1 nerve root via partial hemilaminectomy of right L5 and S1 vertebras and partial dorsal disc resection were performed. The patient was discharged from the hospital three days after surgery with an appropriate clinical status with no postoperative complications. The pain intensity notably decreased after nerve root decompression and remained stable at the check-up three months after surgery (). The patient returned to normal life and recreational sport activities."}
{"patient_id": "118259", "patient": "The patient was a male in his 20s. His chief complaint was diarrhea, melena, and lower abdominal pain. He had no particular family medical and lifestyle histories.\\nThe patient had been previously healthy. Diarrhea 5–6 times a day had appeared 1 month earlier. Two weeks earlier, the patient had decided to visit the family physician following increase in the frequency of diarrhea to 8–10 times a day, accompanied by melena 5 times/day. UC was suspected, and the patient was referred to our hospital for further management. Colonoscopy was performed at our hospital. Since mucosal edema was severe throughout the large intestine, the colonoscopist focused on the transverse colon. Extensive ulceration or undermining ulcer, reduction of visible vascular patterns, and hemorrhagic tendency were noted in the transverse colon compared to the rectum (Fig. ). Based on the clinical symptoms, colonoscopic findings, and results of biopsy, the case was diagnosed as severe pancolitis-type UC, and the patient was admitted for treatment.\\nHe had no past medical history or allergy and no particular family medical history. His status on admission was: height, 183 cm; body weight, 69 kg; blood pressure, 116/67; pulse, 108/min; body temperature, 36.8°C. His defecation frequency was 8–10/day with 4–5/day melena and night defecation. No ulcers in the oral cavity, no congestion or swelling of the skin, and no ulceration of the vulva were found. The abdomen was flat and soft, and moderate spontaneous pain and tenderness were noted in the infraumbilical region.\\nBlood tests on admission showed anemia with Hb of 13.1 g/dL, leukocyte count 9,880/μL, and high erythrocyte count of 58.3 × 104/μL. Biochemical tests showed total protein of 6.4 mg/dL; albumin 2.7 mg/dL; creatinine 0.61 mg/dL; low chloride level of 97 mEq/L, and high C-reactive protein level of 6.66 mg/dL, indicating inflammatory reaction. Coagulation test showed decreased prothrombin time of 62%, and high D-dimer of 2.0 μg/mL. Fecal culture showed indigenous bacteria only (Table ).\\nHe underwent colonoscopy, where the scope was advanced up to the transverse colon. Extensive undermining ulcers, severe mucosal edema, and scope contact-induced hemorrhage were observed in the transverse colon and over the sigmoid colon. Mucosal edema was noted in the rectum, but visible vascular patterns and erosion were only partially observed (Fig. ).\\nTreatment with 4,000 mg aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and prednisolone (PSL) at 60 mg/day was initiated after the diagnosis of UC. Following decreases in the defecation and melena frequencies to 6–7/day and 3–4/day, respectively, and alleviation of abdominal pain at day 3 after initiation of steroid treatment, the PSL dose was gradually decreased to 50 mg/day at day 6, 40 mg/day at day 11, and 30 mg/day at day 16. However, after the last reduction, defecation and melena frequencies increased to 8–10/day and 4–5/day, respectively, and abdominal pain aggravated. Accordingly, the condition was considered steroid-dependent intractable UC, and tacrolimus was administered. A high tacrolimus trough level (10–15 ng/dL) was achieved at day 2 of treatment, which was maintained during the course of treatment. Clinically, 2 weeks of treatment with tacrolimus reduced the defecation frequency to 5–6/day and melena frequency to 1–2/day, though night defecation was still reported, together with mild abdominal pain, but the general clinical condition showed some improvement.\\nColonoscopy was performed to determine the effect of tacrolimus treatment at the end of week 2. The scope was inserted and advanced to the end of the ileum. No mucosal congestion or erosion was noted at the end of the ileum. Bauhin's valve was slightly dilated. Mild mucosal edema was observed from the ileocecum to the ascending colon. Edema was moderate in the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon, and extensive ulcers were still observed, though the mucosa of the ulcer floor showed signs of regeneration and flattening compared with that on previous colonoscopy. In the rectum, only partial congestion was noted (Fig. ).\\nAt the end of week 4 of tacrolimus treatment, the clinical symptoms included further improvement in the frequency of defecation (to 2–3/day) and melena (to 0–1/day), no night defecation, and mild abdominal pain. Since the clinical condition improved, the tacrolimus dose was reduced to a low trough level (5–10 ng/dL). Another colonoscopy performed at the end of the 4-week tacrolimus treatment showed slight congestion of Bauhin's valve, mild mucosal edema from the ileocecum to the ascending colon, mild edema in the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon, with further regeneration and flattening of ulcer floor mucosa compared with that on the previous colonoscopy, persistent disappearance of rectal erosion as observed on previous colonoscopy, together with congested inflammatory polyps (Fig. ).\\nFood ingestion was initiated. The clinical symptoms before initiation of food ingestion were frequency of defecation of 2–3/day and melena of 0–1/day, no night defecation, and no abdominal pain. Colonoscopy performed at the end of week 6 of tacrolimus treatment showed no congestion or erosion at the end of the ileum, slight dilation of Bauhin's valve, a new round ulcer in the inferior lip of Bauhin's valve, fewer areas with visible vascular patterns in the ileocecum to the ascending colon, ulcer scars and inflammatory polyps in the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon, partial improvement of the visible vascular patterns, and lack of erosion in the rectum (Fig. ).\\nAt that stage, Behçet's signs were absent, and no histopathological findings suggestive of BD were identified on the biopsy; accordingly, the new round ulcer in the inferior lip of Bauhin's valve was diagnosed as simple ulcer. The mucosal lesions found in the large intestine, other than those in the ileocecum, showed marked improvement. Accordingly, the PSL dose was gradually reduced, and the patient was discharged. The PSL dose at the time of discharge was 15 mg and it was subsequently reduced to 10 mg. The clinical symptoms at discharge of defecation frequency of 2–3/day without melena or abdominal pain were considered to reflect clinical remission. Cytomegalovirus was negative throughout the hospital stay.\\nAfter discharge, the PSL dose was gradually reduced to discontinuation at the outpatient clinic, whereas tacrolimus and 5-ASA administrations were continued. Oral treatment with azathioprine was initiated at 25 mg/day, but mild nausea developed making continuation of treatment difficult. Remission was clinically maintained. Colonoscopy performed at 12 weeks after the start of tacrolimus treatment showed erosion at the end of the ileum, slight dilation of Bauhin's valve, extension of the round ulcer compared with previous colonoscopy, partial congestion of the ileocecum to the ascending colon, improvement of visible vascular patterns, shrinking ulcer scars and inflammatory polyps in the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon, and complete healing of the rectal mucosa (Fig. ).\\nNo clinical relapse occurred thereafter and remission was maintained. Colonoscopy at the end of 18 weeks of tacrolimus treatment showed only small erosion and slight congestion in the ileocecum, and few areas of mucosal congestion and small erosions scattered in other regions of the large intestine (Fig. ). A repeat colonoscopy at 36 weeks of tacrolimus treatment showed only slight congestion in the ileocecum and healing of the mucosa in other regions (Fig. ). Throughout the clinical course, there were no signs of BD, and all tests and cultures for cytomegalovirus and stool specimens were negative. There was also no history of use of any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."}
{"patient_id": "71845", "patient": "A 41-year-old man (height 171.5 cm, body weight 67 kg) was transferred to the regional medical center due to right hemiplegia and aphagia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral infarction caused by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, while cerebral magnetic resonance angiography showed the development of a network of abnormal collateral vessels. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with MMD.\\nBefore cerebral revascularization surgery, severe MR (III/IV) due to the prolapse of the P2 leaflet in the mitral valve was indicated by transthoracic echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization indicated elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) (systolic/diastolic/mean: 86/33/60 mmHg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (32 mmHg) at the systemic arterial pressure of 120/83/102 mmHg. Hence, the patient was admitted to our university center for the surgical treatment of MR.\\nPreoperative single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere (especially in the external left frontal cortex; Fig. ). Neurosurgeons at our center judged that the patient did not have an indication for cerebral revascularization surgery, which is used to prevent ischemic complications during the perioperative period of mitral valve plasty. This was because his left frontal lobe showed extensive cerebral infarction and no cerebral infarction symptoms were observed in the right cerebral hemisphere. Therefore, mitral valve plasty without cerebral revascularization was chosen.\\nIn the operation room, the patient’s monitoring of electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, systemic arterial pressure via right radial artery catheter, bispectral index, and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) at the right and left forehead (INVOS™ 5100C, Somanetics, USA) was initiated before the administration of general anesthesia. The rSO2 values for the left and right forehead were 72 and 81 %, respectively.\\nGeneral anesthesia was induced by intravenous administration of 3 mg of midazolam, 0.4 mg of fentanyl, and 50 mg of rocuronium. After tracheal intubation, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted. Then, a central venous catheter and right heart catheter were inserted via the right internal jugular vein, and central venous pressure, PAP, cardiac output, and mixed venous oxygen saturation were measured. The nasopharyngeal temperature and urinary bladder temperature were also measured.\\nBefore CPB, general anesthesia was maintained by inhalation of sevoflurane (1–1.5 % of end-tidal concentration). The patient’s PaCO2 was maintained between 38 and 42 mmHg. Intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) was placed at the start of surgery and the augmented pressure was maintained. The mean arterial pressure was constantly above 70 mmHg. Before CPB, rSO2 values were almost above 80 % on both sides (Fig. ).\\nDuring CPB, administration of sevoflurane via the oxygenator was also continued because of its cerebrovascular dilatation activity and potential preconditioning effect against focal cerebral ischemia. PaCO2 was maintained between 45 and 50 mmHg, and alpha-stat management of pH was performed. Hypothermia was induced; the temperature at the bottom of the nasopharyngeal temprature was 28 °C. We used pulsatile perfusion assist to maintain cerebral circulation during CPB with IABP. A decrease in rSO2 was observed 162 min after the initiation of CPB. Our perfusionist increased the CPB pump flow from 2.2 L/min/m2 to 2.8 L/min/m2 in order to increase cerebral blood flow. Moreover, the concentration of sevoflurane was increased to 2 %. Yet, rSO2 desaturation (15 % reduction from baseline) was not improved. We decided to increase the depth-of-anesthesia with another dose of midazolam. After administration of 3 mg of midazolam, the rSO2 values increased from 67 to 73 % on the right side and from 71 to 74 % on the left side. During CPB, the lowest values (and variation) of rSO2 in the left and right forehead were 71 % (−2 %) and 67 % (−17 %), respectively. Mitral valve plasty was performed as planned.\\nAt the weaning from the CPB, the disappearance of MR was confirmed by TEE; the weaning was not difficult. Pulmonary hypertension also improved (PAP was 26/12 mmHg, while systemic arterial pressure was 105/56 mmHg). After CPB, inhalation of sevoflurane (1–1.5 % of end-tidal concentration) was also continued. The rSO2 values were almost above 75 % on both sides and not below the awake rSO2 values (Fig. ). CPB and aortic cross-clamping lasted 352 min and 289 min, respectively. On the completion of the surgery, the IABP was discontinued and sevoflurane administration was stopped. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with ventilator support under propofol sedation.\\nOn the 1st postoperative day (POD), the patient was weaned from the ventilator, and the patient did not complain about any new neurological deficits. We monitored the rSO2 of his forehead until the 2nd POD and no significant decrease (−20 %) of the rSO2 values was confirmed. The postoperative course was uneventful. On the 15th POD, single-photon emission computed tomography revealed that the low cerebral blood flow lesions had not changed (Fig. ), and the patient was discharged from our hospital on the 16th POD."}
{"patient_id": "12206", "patient": "The patient was a 23-year-old Italian male, professional cyclist, non-smoker, 190 cm tall and 82 kg, with a daily training load ranging from three to six hours, six days a week for an upcoming competition. The patient presented with no prior medical record but spontaneous and multidirectional multiple posterior dislocations of the right shoulder. In association with this complaint, the patient stated that he had widespread pain of the GHJ and paresthesias of the entire right hand, but predominantly on the palmar side of the fourth and fifth finger. Moreover, he complained about diffuse spasms (clonic manifestations) occurring around the shoulder, primarily of the pectoralis major and the biceps brachii muscles ().\\nAfter a fall during a cycling race, the athlete went to a medical clinic in March 2017 and was diagnosed with subsequent dislocations of the right shoulder. The fall occurred following contact with a teammate during an international championship while riding on a paved road. The patient was not able to describe the exact traumatic mechanism but remembers his attempt to place his hands toward the ground to avoid the collision. The diagnostic investigation at the time, a magnetic resonance image (MRI), signaled the presence of “intra-articular effusion with non-homogeneity of the antero-inferior portion of the glenoid rim, bone marrow edema on the anterior surface of the humeral head, and an extensive lesion of the subscapularis tendon” (). The anamnestic examination was highlighted by a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) [] of 6/10 (while the patient was at rest), widespread tenderness on the entire joint complex, and positive clinical tests (posterior drawer test, sulcus sign, load and shift, and apprehension test). The patient did not report further trauma to the joint until May 2018, when, during normal work activities (while lifting a box onto a shelf that was above shoulder height), the patient experienced another posterior dislocation of his right shoulder. After this dislocation, the number of episodes of dislocation during limb movements in normal daily activities of living increased in frequency and intensity. Subsequently, spasms of the joint complex followed these episodes and became more frequent with multiple spontaneous and multidirectional dislocations of the shoulder ().\\nIn June 2018, he returned to the clinic, complaining of a worsening of his clinical presentation and symptoms, characterized by an increase in spasmodic muscles surrounding his right shoulder, resulting in spontaneous multidirectional dislocations. The patient stated that these muscle spasms were associated with constant pain that worsened after the event and caused significant instability, weakness, and temporary tingling of the entire hand that was predominately located in the fourth and fifth finger. The spasms did not occur at night during sleep but appeared randomly and without warning throughout the day without apparent cause according to the patient. The patient also noted that the spasms were influenced by the patient’s mental state (with a reported increase of episodes and worsening following family disputes).\\nBy analyzing the patient’s clinical history, family history, and the assessment scales, the PT identified various red and orange flags [] during the medical history and through analysis of the patient’s disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) rating scale (depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders). At the initial evaluation, the PT observed that the right shoulder was in an anterior and internally rotated position. The patient’s right scapula was also abducted and internally rotated. Muscular trophism was reduced in front of the contralateral side: Deltoid, biceps, and pectoral were hypotrophic. No differences in temperature, skin color, or swelling were appreciable and there were no scars present.\\nThe PT had no opportunity to perform any clinical tests as the patient’s passive and active movements immediately set off multidirectional joint dislocations and any type of stimulation increased the spontaneous muscle spasms. Three assessment scales were used by the PT to frame pain presentation (NPRS), disability/psychosocial factors (DASH) [], and instability patterns (Western Ontario shoulder instability index (WOSI)) [].\\nThe patient’s NPRS was 8/10. The DASH score was used to evaluate the disability/psychosocial factors: This scale evaluates the patient’s ability to perform a range of daily, work-related, and sports/recreational activities. The DASH reported a 74.6% disability for daily life activities (ADL) and a 100% disability for work/recreational activities.\\nThe WOSI was used to evaluate the pathology-specific life quality for the patient with shoulder instability and the patient performed at 5.43%."}
{"patient_id": "134996", "patient": "A 57-year-old man presented for evaluation of an incisional hernia and panniculus in April 2016 (). He had a history of laparoscopic gastric bypass 6 years prior and a 54 kg weight loss. His height and weight at presentation were 175 cm and 90 kg, respectively. He was stable at this weight for 3 years and was a non-smoker. In addition to the gastric bypass, surgical history was significant for lap-assisted ileocoloectomy and primary repair of a recurrent umbilical hernia in 2015 for perforated bowel which occurred during colonoscopic polypectomy, primary repair of an umbilical hernia in 2007, and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1997.\\nOn physical exam, he had a well healed midline incision with reducible ventral hernia and umbilical hernia with a hanging panniculus. Abdominal computerized tomography scan showed a midline “Swiss cheese” fascial defect and a left sided periumbilical hernia. The surgical plan included open ventral hernia repair with general surgery in combination with abdominoplasty by plastic surgery. After thorough discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery, the patient was consented for the procedure.\\nIntraoperatively, the hernia extended the length of the previous widened midline incision with the sac densely adhered to the umbilical stalk. The initial surgical plan was to sacrifice the umbilicus, but the decision was made intraoperatively to use the original tissue as a skin graft. Therefore, the umbilicus was excised and placed on the back table (). The hernia sac was excised and the edges of the anterior rectus sheath were separated from the posterior rectus sheath. The fascia was then closed primarily without any undo tension. A fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty was performed with removal of the panniculus and excision of the previous midline scar. In order to create a neoumbilicus, a flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue from each abdominal flap was created and de-epithelialized to provide a vascular bed for the graft to adhere (). This was made using a 3:1 flap design and the flaps were approximately 2×6 cm each. These flaps were sutured together and then secured to the anterior abdominal fascia using 3-0 polyglactin suture. The excised umbilicus was thinned to the dermis on the back table and reapplied to the de-epithelialized flaps as a full thickness graft. A 3-0 polyglactin suture was used to attach the undersurface of the umbilicus to the deep crevasse of the flaps and anterior abdominal wall (). The graft was sutured around its perimeter with 5-0 polypropylene followed by application of a Xeroform bolster.\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. At his initial post-op visit, he demonstrated 100% take of his free umbilical graft. At 9 months postoperatively, his abdomen was free of recurrent hernia and his umbilicus was well healed with an acceptable cosmetic outcome as judged by shape, size, and position of the umbilicus ()."}
{"patient_id": "89861", "patient": "A 14-year-old girl presented with complaints of fatigue, inability to walk, urinary incontinence, dysarthria, and ataxia that had worsened in the last three weeks. She also had fever, weight loss and decreased appetite. In her past medical history she had been treated for seizures with valproic acid (15 mg/kg/day) for three years. Her seizures were documented by EEG findings.\\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg and she had a pulse rate of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min and oral temperature of 38.6°C. Her growth and development were normal, reaching menarche at the age of 13, followed by regular cycles until two months before admission. Her weight was 48 kg and her height was 154 cm. She had received all vaccinations since birth according to the national vaccination plan. Her family history was negative for any hereditary or metabolic disorders.\\nHer consciousness level was normal and she had no neck stiffness. In spite of being awake, she could not communicate with anyone and only used indistinct words. The pupils were normal in size and equally reactive to light. Her sclera were pale.\\nOn neurological examination, her upper limbs were mildly spastic, and her muscle strength was 2–3/5 as far as she could cooperate. Her upper limb reflexes, including the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps, and also her sensory examinations were normal.\\nHer lower limbs, however, were flaccid and atrophic; the muscle strength was 0/5 and the patellar and Achilles reflexes were absent. She showed an extensor plantar reflex. Her lower limb sensory examination showed lost senses of light touch, pain, temperature, vibration and joint position. This may have been unreliable due to her overall condition.\\nAs she was not able to stand or walk, gait and cerebellar examinations were not performed. We also found a deep infected 5 × 4 cm bedsore in her sacral area, as a result of being bedridden for more than three weeks. Her abdominal, chest and heart examinations were normal. Her hemoglobin was 8.3 gr/dl (See Additional file : Table 1 for the CBC result). All other blood tests were normal (See Additional file : Table 2 for other blood tests). Her cerebrospinal fluid examination and chest X-ray were also normal.\\nB12 deficiency was documented by serum vitamin B12 level <100 (normal, 160–970) pg/ml and peripheral blood smear that showed hypersegmented neutrophils (6 and 7 segments).\\nEEG findings included some sharp activity that could indicate epileptogenic activity. The MRI demonstrated senile dilatation in the CSF space and sulci of both hemispheres; a finding compatible with mild atrophic changes (Fig. ).\\nEMG/NCV showed prolonged distal latency of motor nerve, decreased amplitudes of compound muscle action potential, decreased conduction velocity, and increased F wave latencies. Sensory nerve action potentials were not detected. All above finding are compatible with mixed sensorimotor polyneuropathy.\\nTreatment was begun with vitamin B12 (1 mg/IV/day) and folic acid (5 mg/oral/day). After a few weeks, her symptoms improved and she was able to speak and eat. Her upper limb mobility improved and she began to communicate with us. Her reticulocyte count also increased dramatically from 0.9% to 7.1% (on the 7th day of treatment) indicating a favorable treatment response. However, she was febrile in spite of being treated with vancomycin (1 gr/BID) and imipenem (500 mg/QID) which were chosen based on the infected bed sore cultures and antibiograms. After one month, her hemoglobin slightly rose and remained in the range of 8–9 gr/dl. Although her serial blood cultures were negative, she remained febrile, and we suspected an unusual source of infection that did not respond to broad spectrum antibiotics. Therefore, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was performed three weeks after initiating the treatment, and the specimen was examined for unusual germs such as tuberculosis and brucellosis.\\nBone marrow examination (Fig. ) showed some degree of megaloblastic changes, giant metamyelocytes and nuclei/cytoplasm dissociation. The laboratory report showed there were acid fast bacilli in her bone marrow aspiration smear. Therefore, we started a six month antituberculosis treatment with isoniazid 5 mg/kg/day, rifampin 10 mg/kg/day, ethambutol 15 mg/kg/day, and pyrazinamide 20 mg/kg/day.\\nThis treatment resulted in the termination of fever on the second day, further elevation of the hemoglobin level and improvements in her general health. Her upper-limb force became normal and she was able to eat by herself. Her lower-limb force improved and the plantar reflex was now flexor. To find the cause of megaloblastic anemia, we reassessed the case. Valproic acid was not the cause, she was not a vegetarian, and she had no sign or symptoms of malabsorbtion or malnutrition. Her growth and development were normal. We concluded that her vitamin B12 deficiency may be of a gastrointestinal origin. As the Schilling test was not available at our center, we conducted a small bowel series by barium examination and the results showed terminal ileum narrowing, irregularity and mucosal ulceration; all highly indicative of tuberculosis (Fig. ).\\nColonoscopy showed a normal colon but a severely strictured and edematous ileocecal valve, obstructing the path to the terminal ileum for the endoscopic tube.\\nWe concluded that M. tuberculosis had caused the terminal ileum disease and possibly vitamin B12 deficiency in our patient. At present, our patient has been treated for vitamin B12 deficiency and M. tuberculosis. After being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs her fever terminated and her hemoglobin level returned to normal. Currently, 10 months after admission, she can eat, write, and speak normally as well as walk and ride a bicycle, but she has some degree of foot drop. Her latest tests showed a hemoglobin level of 13.7 gr/dl, hematocrit 39.4, and her MCV was 89.3 fl. The small intestine barium examination at the completion of the anti-tuberculosis treatment showed less narrowing and irregularity, which further confirmed the diagnosis."}
{"patient_id": "84951", "patient": "A 6-year-old male patient with a history of mild learning disabilities was referred to our hospital for polyuria and polydipsia and diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes, which rapidly proved to be particularly challenging in terms of metabolic control with fasting blood glucose levels ranging from 203 to 431 g/dl, despite intensive therapy with different therapeutic regimens ().\\nFurther investigation of the disease excluded autoimmune causes (both Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies, ICCA, and Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies, GADA, were negative) and revealed the following HLA haplotype: HLA-A*02, *24; HLA-B*07, * 08; HLA-C*04, * 07; DRB1*03, * 13; DQB1*02, * 06.\\nHis learning disabilities and general pediatric exam suggested a potential visual impairment, which prompted an evaluation by ophthalmology. At age 6, the patient presented with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/20 (3/10), bilateral optic nerve head pallor () and no other retinal abnormalities. The presence of bilateral optic atrophy associated with non-auto immune diabetes suggested a clinical diagnosis of Wolfram Syndrome (WS).\\nAt age 8, nocturnal enuresis became frequent and ultrasonography suggested neurogenic bladder. A deteriorated performance at school was also noted due to problems in speaking (immature speech and difficulties in articulation and phonological processes), reading and interpreting, leading to his failing to pass to the next school year. His intelligence quotient (IQ) was evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and determined to be 64 (an IQ between 50 and 69 is considered “borderline mental functioning” in this testing conditions).\\nAt age 16, the patient had incomplete pubertal development with testicular atrophy associated with increased FSH levels, normal LH and normal total testosterone levels (). His height and weight were 1.65 m (5.41 ft; percentile P 10–25) and 64.5 kg (142.2 lbs; P 50–75), respectively. Regarding his metabolic status, abdominal lipodystrophy was evident and glycemic control remained highly inadequate (HbA1c 8.8 – 9%) under treatment with a 1.5 U/kg daily dose of insulin. His insulin sensitivity factor was 20 g/dl and his insulin/carbohydrates ratio was 5G. Blood pressure was 119/63 mmHg.\\nDuring the 10 years of follow-up, the patient underwent periodic multidisciplinary assessments; inadequate metabolic control was observed throughout these evaluations with HbA1c ranging from 8.6 to 9% despite multiple attempts with different therapeutic combinations and nutritional strategies.\\nOphthalmological assessments revealed a progressive deterioration in BCVA [from 6/20 (3/10), at age 6, to 6/125 (1/20), at age 16] associated with continued atrophy of the optic disc () and significant functional impairment in visual field (Goldmann) and electrophysiological testing. Visual evoked potentials (VEP), an electrophysiological test that measures conductance of electrical impulse from the optic nerve to the brain, were significantly impaired showing increased latency and decreased amplitude of the P100 wave, especially in the left eye. However, no associated changes were noted in the full field ERG. These findings are suggestive of a significant and isolated defect at the level of the optic nerve.\\nThe patient also underwent two audiometry exams at age 10 and 12 that were normal for all hearing frequencies. He did not develop any symptoms suggestive of diabetes insipidus or diabetic vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. His thyroid function and cortisol values were within the normal range of values ().\\nGenetic analyses identified two sequence variants in homozygosity in the WFS1 gene of our patient, who is the second child of a Self-reportedly non-consanguineous couple. The presence of non-consanguinity, however, could not be accurately determined because the father and the family members from the older generation refused to undergo genetic testing.\\nThe sequence variants identified were the following:\\nA novel missense variant c1066T>C (pSer356Pro), in exon 8;\\nA previously described variant c482G>A (pArg161Gln), in exon 5, initially associated with low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL) [] and later described in the 1000 Genomes Project [] and interpreted as benign by Shearer et al. [].\\nHis mother and his 19-year-old sister were heterozygous for the same sequence variants in the WFS1 gene, while the 11-year-old brother did not present any variations (). These findings highly suggest that (1) both sequence variants must be located on the same chromosome (haplotype) and that (2) the presence of the two haplotypes in homozygosity is the cause for Wolfram syndrome in this family."}
{"patient_id": "131138", "patient": "A 29-year-old woman visited our hospital with a palpable left breast mass and right chest wall mass in March of 2017. She had some unique phenotypic features and medical history. Her height, weight, and head circumference were 167 cm, 64 kg, and 58.1 cm, respectively. The mean head circumference of average (±standard deviation) adult women in Korea is 55.2±1.47 cm []. Her mother said that her birth weight was about 3.5 kg and she looked like she had a big head at birth. She was diagnosed with some developmental delay during infancy and childhood. She had undergone a near-total thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter at the ages of 9 and 14 years, respectively. The pathology report confirmed nodular hyperplasia. However, there is no family history of breast or other cancers. She has two sisters and they also have not had any special illnesses.\\nWe conducted tests on the patient. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregularly shaped, 9.7-cmsized mass in the left and a well circumscribed, 6.8-cm-sized mass arising from the subcutaneous fat layer of the right ( and ). Multiple pulmonary nodules were detected on breast computed tomography (CT) (). A core needle biopsy of both was performed and pathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left and poorly differentiated spindle cell tumor in the right. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography–CT showed an intensely FDG-avid mass (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] 12.5) in the left breast and a heterogeneously and moderately FDG-avid pedunculated subcutaneous mass (SUVmax 4.6) in the right breast. There were multiple pulmonary nodules less than 1.5 cm in size with mild FDG uptake (SUVmax 1.7) and focal nodular lesions with moderate FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe (SUVmax 3.4) ().\\nShe underwent a modified radical bilateral mastectomy in March 2017. Histopathological examination of the left breast mass revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma with squamous metaplastic carcinoma (). Tumor size was 8 cm and there were 11 metastatic lymph nodes among the 31-dissected left axillary lymph nodes. Thus, pathological staging was pT3N3aMx. Immunohistochemical analyses showed negative staining for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Histopathological examination of the right mass revealed a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, grade 2 (-). Tumor size was 7.5 cm diameter and there were no metastatic right axillary lymph nodes. Thus, pathological staging was pT2a-N0Mx.\\nIn addition, we found that she had more phenotypic features of importance. She had mucosal papillomatous lesions on the upper gingiva and hard palate (). There were no other mucocutaneous lesions such as trichilemmomas and acral keratosis. X-ray images of her abdomen showed mild to moderated scoliosis. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed and we found multiple gastrointestinal polyps distributed throughout the entire intestine (). Based on her phenotypic features and medical history, we suspected that she might have PHTS. We performed a PTEN gene test and identified a frameshift PTENmutation: c.723dupT (p.Glu242Terfs) in exon 7 (). This is a pathogenic mutation of PTEN that was described previously in patients with PHTS [,].\\nAfter discussing her case among our multidisciplinary team, we decided to follow up on her pulmonary nodules while performing chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer because they were too small to make a diagnosis by CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy. She received four cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. After the four cycles of chemotherapy, chest CT showed no change in pulmonary nodules. To determine an appropriate plan for further treatment, we performed a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of pulmonary nodule. Surprisingly, histopathological examination revealed colloid-filled thyroid follicles with various sizes in the lung ( and ). Subsequently, a core needle biopsy of her right thyroid nodule was performed and revealed a follicular neoplasm. She received adjuvant weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. After the completion of 12 weekly cycles of paclitaxel, she underwent both total thyroidectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and pathologic report revealed minimally invasive follicular carcinoma ( and ). We plan to perform radioactive iodine therapy. Her family will receive genetic counseling from a specialist."}

He had been treated for diabetes mellitus and coronary spastic angina, which were well-controlled, and was scheduled for video-assisted LLL. He was an active healthcare professional with no history of arrhythmia or thromboembolism. He reported a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 30 years but had quit smoking at the age of 47. A preoperative electrocardiograph showed sinus rhythm, first-degree atrioventricular block, and left anterior hemiblock, but no arrhythmia was detected. Preoperatively, he had a normal platelet count (23.2 × 104/μL) and no coagulation disturbance (prothrombin time international normalized ratio 0.91, activated partial thromboplastin time 27.1 s).\\nThe operation was performed uneventfully under general anesthesia with epidural anesthesia. The operative time was 289 min. The pathological stage was found to be stage I.\\nThe patient was ambulatory from postoperative day 1 and had no trouble on that day. On the morning of postoperative day 2, his epidural catheter was removed. He experienced sudden pain in his left calf while going back to bed after brushing his teeth. He complained of this symptom one and a half hours after the epidural catheter removal. His left dorsalis pedis artery was not palpable, but the bilateral femoral and popliteal arteries were palpable, which suggested thrombotic occlusion. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan, taken an hour after his complaint, showed an occluded left popliteal artery, a poorly described left dorsalis pedis artery (Fig. ), and thrombus formation in the left lower PV stump (Fig. ). His blood test revealed an elevated d-dimer level of 3.06 μg/mL. Heparin and alprostadil were started 3 h after the epidural catheter removal, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for endovascular thrombectomy. He had no subsequent complications and was discharged with edoxaban medication. The PV stump thrombus was not found in the CECT scan performed 3 weeks after surgery. Therefore, anticoagulant therapy was stopped."}
{"patient_id": "143418", "patient": "A 19-year-old female patient (body weight: 52.7 kg, height: 158.4 cm) was admitted to the university hospital for percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation of a reninoma in the lower pole of the left kidney. The patient had been taking the angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan (8 mg), or the combined calcium channel blocker and angiotensin II receptor blocker, amlodipine besylate (5 mg)/valsartan (160 mg), for 2 years to control what was presumed to be essential hypertension. The patient was diagnosed with essential hypertension 2 years prior because laboratory examinations including renal ultrasonography and cardiac echocardiography and renin, aldosterone and vanillylmandelic acid levels were all within the normal limits. However, when an abdominal CT was performed 1 year ago to confirm acute appendicitis, a small left renal mass (2 cm) was incidentally found and suspected to be benign. Four computed tomographies of abdomen were performed during follow-up to monitor the change in mass every 3 months for 1 year. The fourth follow-up CT showed that the size of the renal mass (2.3 × 1.8 cm) was slightly enlarged, and a radiologist recommended a biopsy of the mass to confirm whether the mass was malignant or benign. The results from the ultrasonography-guided renal biopsy of the renal mass indicated that the mass was a reninoma. At that time, blood examination of the patient indicated increased renin and angiotensin I and II levels, which are consistent with a reninoma (). The patient was scheduled to receive percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia to destroy the reninoma in the left kidney.\\nThe physical examination upon admission was unremarkable and did not show any end-organ damage due to hypertension, as is expected with well-controlled hypertension. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures, controlled by amlodipine besylate (5 mg)/valsartan (160 mg), were 110-131 and 62-82 mmHg, respectively, at the time of admission. In particular, a preoperative electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest posteroanterior radiography at the time of admission were all within the normal limits. She was taking amlodipine besylate (5 mg)/valsartan (160 mg) at the time of admission. She had a past anesthetic history of receiving general anesthesia for an appendectomy approximately 1 year prior and did not have any specific family history of anesthesia. Amlodipine besylate/valsartan was omitted on the day of the operation. No premedication was given for sedation. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium (250 mg), servoflurane (6 vol%) and rocuronium bromide (50 mg), and the patient received oxygen (100%) through a facemask. Orotracheal intubation was performed using a reinforced endotracheal tube (internal diameter: 7.0 mm). The left radial artery was cannulated using a 20-gauge catheter to monitor intraoperative blood pressure. Anesthesia was maintained with servoflurane (2-4 vol%) in oxygen (2 L/min). The patient's position was changed from supine to prone, and the patient was transferred to the table for CT. shows the intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate for every 5 min interval. When the first radiofrequency wave for percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation was given to the reninoma using an adjustable active tip (Proteus radiofrequency ablation electrode; STARmed, Ilsan, Korea), the patient's heart rate transiently increased from 74 beats/min to 104 beats/min. When the next nine radiofrequency waves were given using a 2.5 to 3 cm active tip, the intraoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were 71-84, 77-86, and 80-92% of the preoperative value, respectively. In other words, the intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate were relatively stable. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure transiently increased from 65 beats/min to 102 beats/min and from 96 mmHg to 114 mmHg, respectively, when the last CT was taken 5 min before the operation ended. Normal saline (300 ml) was intraoperatively infused, and the intraoperative urine output was estimated to be 70 ml. The operation ended uneventfully, without any of the reported possible complications, including perirenal hematoma, hematuria, ureteropelvic junction obstruction and liver burn []. The total time for both anesthesia and operation was approximately 2 hours. The patient was extubated after adequate self-respiration was confirmed and clear consciousness was observed. The blood pressure and heart rate at extubation were maintained at preanesthetic levels. The patient was transferred to a recovery room using a movable bed, and the patient's position was changed from prone to supine in the movable bed. shows that stable blood pressure and heart rate were maintained by the patient for approximately 70 min in the postanesthetic recovery room. The patient was transferred to the general ward 70 min after the operation. shows the blood pressure and heart rate of the patient when in the general ward. As shown in , the patient had a stable blood pressure and heart rate for the initial 3 hours and 15 min spent in the general ward. Intravenous pethidine was given 3 hours after the operation to control postoperative pain. Normal saline (300 ml) was infused for 5 hours after the operation, and then the patient had a soft meal. When the patient sat up from a lying position to eat a soft meal approximately 5 hours after the operation, the patient complained of severe dizziness. At that time, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were 89/46 mmHg and 82 beats/min, respectively. Then, normal saline (500 ml) was intravenously infused over 15 min, which increased the systolic/diastolic blood pressure to 111/63 mmHg and significantly improved the dizziness of the patient. Then, the patient received an intravenous infusion of normal saline (1 L) at a rate of 120 ml/hr during the remaining time spent in the general ward. The blood pressure of the patient was stable throughout the remaining period in the general ward, but mild dizziness still occurred. The patient was uneventfully discharged from the hospital 18 hours after the operation. Although the patient's blood pressure was within the normal limits, the patient suffered mild orthostatic dizziness for approximately 4 weeks after discharge. Although she did not take antihypertensive drugs after the operation, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures at home were within the normal limits. At 1 month after the operation, the mild dizziness completely resolved and renin and angiotensin II levels were within the normal limits, but angiotensin I remained slightly increased ()."}

He had history of atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve (MV) with consequent severe mitral stenosis. He was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. He had no family history of relevance. He weighed 60 kg and his height was 168 cm.\\nThe patient underwent an uneventful mitral valve replacement using a mechanical 29 mm St Jude prosthesis. He was commenced on oral anticoagulant (warfarin) and a beta blocker. His pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a well-functioning prosthesis with no paravalvular leak. Six months later, the patient presented to his local hospital with exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. He admitted that he had stopped taking his oral anticoagulant therapy 10 days prior to hospitalization: his international normalized ratio was 1.0.\\nHis physical examination showed atrial fibrillation, absent prosthetic click and congested lungs but was otherwise unremarkable. Routine blood investigations were normal. TTE showed immobile posterior mitral leaflet and mobile anterior leaflet with a mean pressure gradient of 20 mmHg (peak pressure 40 mmHg) and reduced surface area of 0.7 cm2. He was then referred to our center. His New York Heart Association class on arrival was II and he was in a stable hemodynamic status. A repeat TTE at our center showed a huge left atrial (LA) thrombus in the posterolateral aspect of LA involving the posterior cusp of MV prosthesis which kept it in a closed position with a mobile anterior leaflet (Figure and ). These findings were confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE).\\nWe proceeded with thrombolytic treatment using tenecteplase (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) in a slow intravenous infusion of 1.25 mg/h (dose was 0.5 mg/kg and the patient body weight was 60 kg). The patient was closely monitored in an intensive care unit for any sign of cerebral embolism or bleeding. Thrombolysis was continuous for 48 hours. Following 24 hours of tenecteplase treatment, a repeat TTE showed recovery of most of the MV mobility (Figure Figure and ) with a significant decrease in LA thrombus size and a recovering blood flow across the MV. The MV area was 2.7 cm2 with no paravalvular leak and pericardial effusion.\\nAfter 48 hours of treatment, a TEE showed well functioning MV prosthesis with no residual thrombus (Figure and ). The surface area was 2.8 cm2 and the peak pressure gradient across MV was 6 mmHg with a mean pressure gradient of 2 mmHg. Following thrombolysis, intravenous anticoagulation (unfractionated heparin) was started as a continuous infusion together with oral anticoagulation therapy (warfarin). The combination was then continued until his International Normalised Rate was in the therapeutic range and then heparin was discontinued.

His weight and height were 70 kg and 173.5 cm, respectively with BMI 23.25. On medical history he had chest pain and for the same was admitted to Hamad general Hospital 1 year back. There was no history of chest pain after that episode, syncope, palpitations in the past. He was investigated with normal blood investigations during that time. But on ECG there was RBBB with ST elevation (coved) in lead V1–V3. Holtermonitorings were done suggestive of atrial premature contractions. On the stress test, as per Bruce protocol, it was negative with the target rate, no ECG abnormality. So cardiologist suggested that baseline ECG suggestive of Brugada syndrome. He was having past history of productive cough, which was diagnosed as asthmatic bronchitis 3 weeks back. He received antibiotics and salbutamol inhaler (as and when required- last used 3 weeks back). There was family history of father's sudden death, but details are not available. No past surgical or allergic history. On general and airway examination was normal except fever. Systemic examination was normal except abdominal tenderness. Chest X-ray was normal. ECG findings same as before RBBB with ST elevation (coved) in lead V1–V3 with QTc 420 msec.\\nLooking at clinical examination, investigations and as per surgical indication, general anesthesia with avoidance of sodium channel blocker medications was planned. Detail explanation given to patient and consent was taken. Routine monitorings were used. Defibrillator was kept ready. Atropine as per routine was kept ready for abolish any vagal effect. As any vagal stimulation in this type of cases, this leads to dysrrthymias.\\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg/ kg and neuromuscular blockade provided through atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Analgesia was supplemented with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and patient maintained on sevoflurane with air for controlled ventilation. Paracetamol 1 gm intravenous was given. Spontaneous extubation was carried out with smooth emergence and breathing spontaneously, obeying commands, and satisfactory muscle power. Neostigmine was avoided due to its ability to produce dysrthymia in these cases. Postoperative analgesia provided with morphine in titrated doses. Postoperative care was given in the postanaesthesia care unit. No untoward events (no bradycardia or ventricular fibrillation) occurred during the anesthesia. Total surgery and anaesthesia times were 45 and 65 min, respectively. Invasive monitorings were avoided due to short surgical procedure without much haemodynamic instability.

{"patient_id": "24948", "patient": "A 59-year-old Korean female came in with a chief complaint of palpable mass present in shoulder and upper back regions (Fig. ). She had not previously received any diagnosis of disease except for psychiatric conditions. Height, weight, and BMI of the patient were 158 cm, 63 kg, and 25.2, respectively. Physical examination was done, and other than the presence of palpable protruding mass, no clinical signs or specific symptoms (e.g., pain or numbness) have been found. Ultrasonography was the first imaging study performed (Fig. ), which revealed characteristics of lipoma. Computed tomography (CT) images and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained to evaluate the depth and distribution of mass. Diffuse non-encapsulated adipose tissues were found in subcutaneous layers of suboccipital and posterior neck. There was no mass surrounding the tracheal area (Figs. , ). Partial excision of the mass was planned because the patient wanted it removed for cosmetic reasons and physical discomfort. There were no apparent brain lesions in MRI and no specific findings in neurologic examinations. The preoperative evaluation included plain radiography of the thorax, electrocardiography, and blood analyses. Our patient had impaired fasting glucose levels and elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and uric acid levels. The values for total cholesterol and rheumatic factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides, and antinuclear antibody levels were within the reference ranges. The laboratory findings are presented in Table . Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-B) scores were 2.6 and 68.7% respectively, which meant that the patient had early insulin resistance. Additional history taking revealed that she had a history of high alcohol consumption. The patient consumed 48.6 g of alcohol daily, which is a high risk for alcohol consumption according to WHO criteria [, ].. Abdominal ultrasound and liver CT were performed in order to determine any existing hepatobiliary problems. Mild gallbladder edema was found in ultrasound. The CT scan found liver cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly. Consequently, the patient received a diagnosis of compensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Classification B) due to heavy alcohol consumption. Under general anesthesia, excisional biopsies were performed via lipectomy at accumulated areas (Fig. a). The histological findings revealed large dystrophic adipocyte morphology. However, there were no findings of any sarcomatous changes (Fig. b, c). There were no problems with wound healing (e.g., infection, hematoma, or seroma formation) during the post-operative period.

{"patient_id": "120120", "patient": "A 73-year-old male (height, 158 cm; weight, 62 kg) was referred by the cardiology department to the rehabilitation department because of a 3-week history of left foot drop. He also complained of numbness and a tingling sensation on the left lateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. At the time of referral, the left leg and foot were soft and non-tender. Only the right dorsalis pedis was pulsatile, but not on the left side. Pain in the left lateral lower leg and dorsum of foot was scored 3/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The Medical Research Council scale for weakness showed the following grades (right/left): hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, ankle dorsiflexion 5/1, and hallucis extension 5/1. He had no lower back pain and the straight leg raise reached 80° on both sides. A positive Tinel's sign behind the fibular neck on the left side was noted. In a nerve conduction study, there was no compound motor action potential in the left deep peroneal nerve on the left extensor digitorum brevis or tibialis anterior muscle recordings, and no evoked sensory nerve action potential in the left superficial peroneal nerve (). Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity at rest and no motor unit action potential activity in the left tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscles (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery (ATA) () without any abnormal findings of the soft tissue. This led to a diagnosis of left common peroneal neuropathy due to occlusion of the left ATA. The patient was treated with oral warfarin.\\nThe patient's medical history was reviewed. He did not have diabetes mellitus. He received a mitral valve replacement 5 years ago due to mitral stenosis, and echocardiography showed a moderate degree of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, he had complete atrioventricular block and valvular atrial fibrillation; and had a pacemaker inserted three years prior to referral. However, he had been prescribed only an antiplatelet agent because of a history of cerebellar intracranial hemorrhage 2 years previously.\\nApproximately 4 weeks prior to referral, he visited another hospital suffering from chest pain, and received percutaneous coronary angiography which took about 30 minutes. After percutaneous coronary angiography, he received conservative care in a general ward, without any physical restrain or requirement for absolute bed rest. He could ambulate the ward with only minimal assistance. Some days later, he complained of left leg weakness and a brain CT was performed to rule out an acute brain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated because of the cardiac pacemaker. The brain CT showed a subacute ischemic lesion in the right posterior temporal region but it did not clinically correlate with the weakness. Although he complained of foot drop and paresthesia, there were no symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome such as tenderness, redness or swelling of low leg. No deep vein thrombosis or abnormal findings of soft tissues were found upon ultrasonography of the left leg. After improvement of the chest pain, he was discharged home. Two weeks later he was admitted to the cardiology department in the present hospital due to chest pain, and was referred to the rehabilitation department. After diagnosis of the left common peroneal neuropathy and improvement of the chest discomfort with conservative therapy, he was transferred and received rehabilitation."}
{"patient_id": "152208", "patient": "A 30-year-old pregnant woman (58 kg, 157 cm) at 33 weeks gestation was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with DSS. After being fluid resuscitated, she developed acute respiratory failure likely to be secondary to fluid overload. A trial of noninvasive ventilation was started to which she failed to response. Hence, a decision was made to proceed with TI.\\nFollowing a rapid sequence induction, a grade I laryngoscopic view was obtained, and the trachea was smoothly intubated with a 7.0-mm internal diameter standard endotracheal tube (ETT). The tube was secured with its 20-cm mark at the incisor. A central venous line was uneventfully inserted over her right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance. Postintubation, her oxygenation deteriorated further. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) increased to 35 cm H2O, and she became more tachycardic and hypertensive. On auscultation, breath sounds (BS) were heard over the left lung fields but were reduced overall the right lung fields with fine crepitations up to mid-zones of both lungs. Portable chest radiograph (CR) was obtained, but the result was not immediately available. Our differential diagnosis at this point was right-sided pneumo- or hemothorax. However, there were no hyper-resonance or stony dullness on percussion to suggest these possibilities. Misplacement of the tube endobronchially was not considered because the ETT would usually enter the RMB causing reduced BS over the left lung instead. Finally, we concluded that the hypoxemia was due to the progression of her lungs condition to severe pulmonary edema.\\nIn view of her worsening condition, the obstetric team planned for emergency cesarean section for maternal indication. While waiting for the surgery, the CR became available 1 h later, showing a complete whiteout of the right hemithorax with the tip of the ETT in the LMB []. The ETT was pulled back 2 cm, backing it out to 18 cm at the incisor. However, the patient continued to have decreased BS over the right lung, and her oxygenation did not improve. At this point, we did not withdraw the tube further for two reasons: (1) It was already at the minimum expected depth for the patient and (2) should dislodgement of the tube occurs while withdrawing it, the risk of aspiration is high due to pregnancy. Hence, we planned for a fiber optic bronchoscopy (FB) in the operation theater at the end of surgery to look for the cause of the decrease right-sided BS.\\nDuring transportation and the intra-operative period, the oxygen saturation maintained at about 95% under 100% inspired oxygen. At the end of the surgery, FB was performed, which showed six bronchial rings from the tip of the ETT before a bifurcation. This was identified as the division of the LMB into the secondary bronchi of the upper and lower lobes of the left lung. Recognizing that the ETT was still in the LMB, we pulled it back another 3 cm such that its tip was 2 cm above the carina. The ETT was then re-secured with its 15-cm mark at the incisor. The patient suddenly had a full return of BS over the right lung, her oxygen saturation slowly improved to 100% and the PIP decreased to about 25 cm H2O.\\nPostoperatively, she was returned to the ICU for optimization and weaning from the ventilator. Repeat CR showed good re-expansion of the right lung parenchyma with the ETT tip at 2 cm above the carina []. She was extubated on the first postoperative day and was discharged well to the ward about 24 h later. In the ward, she continued to do well until hospital discharge 5 days later."}

Physical examination revealed temperature of 39°C, pulse of 86 beats/min, blood pressure of 144/76 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min. Her head circumference was 52 cm (25-50th percentile), her body weight was 70 kg (75-90th percentile), and her height was 165 cm (50-75th percentile). Her body weight for height exceeded the standard deviation. The initial neurologic examination revealed a lethargic state with signs of meningeal irritation, hypoactive deep tendon reflexes, muscle weakness, and positive Babinski sign on left side. She had hepatosplenomegaly measured at 3 cm at the costal margin.\\nThe laboratory data obtained on admission are listed in . CSF examination revealed protein at 48 mg/dL, glucose at 45 mg/dL, 30 leukocyte/mm3, and the polymerase chain reaction for HSV Type 1 and CSF bacterial culture were negative. Antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative and serum immunoglobulins levels were normal.\\nThe cerebral MRI showed contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted images with enhancement of meningeal surface in the right hemisphere that was consistent with right hemi-meningitis []. The patient's electroencephalogram was normal. Vancomycin, cefotaxime, and acyclovir infusions were started. Acyclovir was stopped when CSF HSV Type 1 PCR became negative. On the fifth day of treatment, vancomycin-related red-man syndrome developed, so the treatment was stopped. There were partial recurrent seizures on her left arm, which were controlled with an IV midazolam infusion and oral valproic acid treatment. Her antibiotic treatment stopped on the 14th day of treatment, and her examination was nearly normal; however, on the 15th day of admission, her fever and sedimentation increased again. Her laboratory results showed severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count: 0.0/μl) and anemia []. Because the peripheral blood smear showed increased monocytes, and she also had hepatomegaly, bicytopenia with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and triglyceride levels, bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was performed. The BMA revealed a hypercellular marrow, without hemophagocytosis. Meropenem, amikacin, and amphotericin treatment were given. Hypermetabolic lymph nodes on the left cervical and bilateral axillar regions were shown on the positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Her symptoms and laboratory findings were strongly consistent with HLH; therefore BMA was repeated, and the smear showed an increased number of histiocytes with hemophagocytosis []. In serologic examination, EBV VCA IgM became positive. The patient met the diagnostic criteria of HLH, and she recovered completely with steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment."}

There was no history of chronic diseases and chronic medications. In 1996, a right-sided nephrectomy was performed due to a localized renal cell carcinoma. Fourteen years later, in May 2010, multiples nodules in his pancreas were discovered in a follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan for which a biopsy was indicated. On admission, our patient appeared in good general condition. His temperature was 37 °C; blood pressure, 130/85 mmHg; pulse rate, 73 beats per minute; and respiration rate, 15 per minute, weight 69 kg, and height 172 cm. On physical examination, his abdomen was soft, painless, without peritoneal symptoms. His neurological system was unremarkable. His cranial nerves were intact and power in his upper and lower limbs were 5/5 throughout. A histologic examination of the biopsy revealed the diagnosis of a pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. A complete body scan for staging was performed. Isolated metastases involving the pancreas were detected. He met International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database (IMDC) favorable-risk criteria, with a Karnofsky performance score of 90% and corrected calcium and blood counts within the normal range, including hemoglobin (Hb) of 14.2 g/dL (normal range 13.5–17.0). Serum creatinine was 11 mg/L (estimated creatinine clearance 86 mL/min). Indolent disease based on body CT imaging with 4 years of follow-up was recognized. Active surveillance with deferred sunitinib at disease progression was performed. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of his pancreatic lesions in May 2014. A complete blood count was normal (Table ). His hepatitis B and C screenings were negative. His echocardiograph was normal for left ventricular ejection fraction and his baseline performance score was 0. We decide to start treatment with sunitinib 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks off. Evaluation of the tumor response was done according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors by spiral CT scan, and after three cycles of sunitinib observed a partial response (30% reduction in size and 50% density of pancreatic lesions). In September 2014, our patient reported different side effects, like headache, the onset of grade III skin rash, mucosal toxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity managed by supportive care and dose interruption. Hence the dose was reduced to 37.5 mg in a 3/4 schedule. He received 15 cycles of oral sunitinib. In November 2015, restaging CT scan after this regimen continued to show stable disease consistent with partial response per response evaluation criteria in solid tumor. He developed weakness and grade II hypothyroidism (Table ) managed by one thyroxin supplementation. Sunitinib was reduced at dose of 25 mg (schedule 2/1). Therefore, our patient asked for a break of the sunitinib administration, and the treatment was stopped after a 9-month period. After receiving therapy for 28 months, sunitinib therapy was therefore discontinued in September 2016. Nowadays; our patient is under oncologic follow-up. He is still maintaining stable disease, excellent overall heath and a 0 performance score. Time of disease control after sunitinib discontinuation was 13 months. A follow-up abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation every 4 months revealed stable disease (Fig. ). Nowadays, the patient emphasizes feeling much better after treatment with sunitinib ended. Pancreatic metastases from renal cell cancer showed no signs of progression, neither clinically nor in MRI."}

She was treated with trichlormethiazide for hypertension and did not have any history of allergy or ACS. Preoperative ECG showed a flat ST segment. Routine laboratory investigations were normal. Within the past year, the patient had undergone TUR-BT twice under spinal anesthesia and once under GA using propofol, desflurane, fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium. Cefazolin was administered intravenously during every surgery.\\nAfter placement of a thoracic epidural catheter, GA was induced with propofol, rocuronium, and fentanyl, and it was maintained with desflurane, remifentanil, and rocuronium. After the trachea was intubated, cefazolin was administered intravenously and TUR-BT started. Forty-five minutes after induction of GA, the resistance of the respiratory tract increased gradually under sufficient effect of rocuronium without any mechanical respiratory problem. Tidal volume in the mechanical ventilator decreased approximately from 350 to 250 ml under pressure-controlled ventilation. Percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) decreased from 100 to 94% with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40% without wheeze. Sixty minutes after induction of GA, the ST segment in lead II of the ECG decreased to − 1.0 mV and isosorbide dinitrate was administered intermittently under the suspicion of ACS. Because of further progression of ST segment depression, we initiated continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin and nicorandil. As the systolic blood pressure (SBP) dropped to 70 mmHg, continuous phenylephrine and intermittent ephedrine were administered to maintain SBP at 80 mmHg. Seventy-three minutes after induction of GA, TUR-BT was finished and the ST segment decreased to − 3.4 mV maximally. When the surgical drape was removed, an anaphylactic erythematous rash was observed on the abdomen, chest, arms, and legs. Then, we suspected anaphylactic reaction to an unknown agent of KS. Corticosteroid and chlorpheniramine were administered immediately.\\nTransthoracic echocardiography findings were within normal limits. The 12-lead ECG revealed ST depression in I, II, aVF, and V3–6. The laboratory findings for troponin and CK-MB were normal. As the patient responded well to the treatment for anaphylaxis, we were able to stop continuous phenylephrine administration 101 min after induction of GA and the ST depression began to return gradually. Subsequent left nephroureterectomy was postponed and ureteral stent insertion was carried out. When the ureteral stent insertion ended 166 min after induction of GA, blood pressure and the ST depression returned to almost normal with nitroglycerin and nicorandil support. The cutaneous symptoms diminished and SpO2 returned to 100% under the same oxygen concentration. Rocuronium was reversed by sugamadex and the trachea was extubated. The vital signs were stable and the patient was free of chest pain and respiratory discomfort. She was transferred to the ICU in order to observe any recurrence of anaphylactic reaction and stayed overnight uneventfully. Based upon the findings of normal coronary vasculature in coronary computerized tomography (CT) 4 days after TUR-BT, the cardiologist diagnosed the case as type 1 variant KS. Five days after TUR-BT, intradermal tests with all of the drugs used during GA were negative.\\nEleven days after TUR-BT, laparoscopic left nephroureterectomy was performed under GA and epidural anesthesia. Since cefazolin was one of suspected causes of KS at that time, ciprofloxacin was administered in the ward before surgery and no reaction was observed. Preventative intravenous corticosteroid and chlorpheniramine were administered before GA, and continuous intravenous nicorandil was administered during surgery. GA was induced by thiamylal and suxamethonium and maintained with desflurane, fentanyl, and remifentanil. The minimum dose of rocuronium was administered intermittently to keep T1 of train-of-four under neuromuscular monitoring throughout the surgery. The surgery was completed uneventfully. The patient was discharged on the 18th day after the first operation. The intradermal test performed 8 months later proved that cefazolin was a trigger drug."}
{"patient_id": "145960", "patient": "A 40-year-old woman with undifferentiated connective tissue disease had been taking hydroxychloroquine for 7.7 years. She was originally on 400 mg/day but more recently was taking 300 mg/day. Her height was 162.6 cm, her ideal body weight 63 kg, her actual body weight 65.9 kg, and her cumulative dose was 1,124 g. She had no renal or liver disease and no pre-existing maculopathy. shows eight consecutive 10-2 VFs performed with a white target. Only one of the eight VFs lacks at least one scotoma point (the fifth VF). All others contain scotoma points that are characterized by failure to be reproduced at the subsequent testing. Many of the scotoma points are in the high-risk zone from 2 to 8 degrees from fixation, which some have advocated as grounds for more intensified testing. As the patient had a low pre-test probability of retinopathy (nontoxic daily dosing, low cumulative dose in the early years of testing, and no renal or liver disease), no intensified testing was done. shows that in 2014, she had normal SD-OCT and mfERG ancillary testing, corroborating the lack of evidence of retinopathy seen in all of the VFs."}
{"patient_id": "155770", "patient": "A 20-year-old woman at 18 weeks of gestation suddenly collapsed and was transferred to our stroke center. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed a large intracerebral hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal lobes (). On admission, she already had anisocoria of pupils (right side:Ø6.0mm, left side:Ø1.5mm) due to impending cerebral herniation. So, craniotomy was performed immediately for the evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma without investigating further for the cause or the origin of the bleed. Bleeding source could not be detected during the operative procedure. After surgery, she showed good recovery and the fetus was normal. At 16 days after surgery, she regained consciousness and underwent conventional cerebral angiography with lead sheets to reduce the fetal exposure to radiation and her right internal carotid angiograms revealed a deeply seated small frontal AVM with a maximum diameter of 21 mm extending to the basal ganglia (). On the basis of the angiographic findings, we interpreted that the nidus of AVM was non-compact and was intervening the brain parenchyma (diffuse AVM). This case was discussed at a multidisciplinary treatment planning conference. Surgical resection was not recommended due to the risk of neurological deficits. Further, conservative treatment had a risk of subsequent hemorrhage and was bound to be associated with high maternal mortality rates. Finally, SRS was recommended if the irradiation to the inner pelvis could be kept exceedingly low in order to avoid any damage to the fetus.\\nBefore SRS was performed, we assessed the fetal exposure to radiation by the LINAC (MEVATRON77DX67, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Concord, CA, USA) which delivered 10 MV X-ray beams at multiple noncoplanar converging arcs, by using an adult RANDO phantom (Alderson Research Laboratories, Inc., Stamford, CT, USA) [] and a radiophotoluminescent (RPL) glass rod dosimeter (GRD) system (Dose Ace®, Chiyoda Technol Corporation, Tokyo, Japan)[].\\nThe RANDO phantom and the RPL-GRD systems are briefly described below. The RANDO phantom is composed of a genuine human skeleton embedded in a mass with the properties of human soft tissue (effective atomic number Zeff = 7.3 ; mass density ρ = 0.985g . cm-3) and is of the average female size (height, 163 cm; weight, 54 kg). The RPL-GRD system is composed of readout equipment with the standard dosimeter and small one-element silver-activated metaphosphate glass detectors. The weight composition of GRD is as follows: 31.55% P, 51.16% O, 6.12% Al, 11.0% Na, and 0.17% Ag (Zeff = 12.039; ρ = 2.16g . cm-3). The GRD is 8.5 mm (GD-301) in length and has a diameter of 1.5 mm. We used the RPL-GRD system because it is known to produce a smaller standard deviation in dose measurement as compared to thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) []. We placed 6 PRL-GRDs on the abdominal surface and 9 in the pelvic region of the phantom to predict the location of the uterus and the fetus (). The irradiation to the GRD was measured after administering 20 Gy to the intracranial target in the right basal ganglia with a maximum diameter of 21 mm on the LINAC table (). In the absence of lead sheets over the phantom's abdomen, the average radiation doses to the abdominal surface and inner pelvis were 8.86 mGy (range, 7.98-9.80 mGy), and 5.21 mGy (range, 4.56-5.87 mGy), respectively. The fetal exposure to radiation during SRS appeared to be extremely low, and the patient and her family consented to the radiosurgical treatment.\\nShe underwent LINAC-based SRS at 24 weeks of gestation with lead sheets placed over her abdomen to reduce the exposure to her fetus. The treatment was planned on the basis of contrast-enhanced thin-slice CT imaging data. We placed 10 RPL-GRDs between her abdominal surface and the lead sheets. Two isocenters with 12 mm and 9 mm circular collimators were used to deliver a radiation dose of 20 Gy to the lesion at 80% isodose line. The exposure angles were tailored to reduce the exposure to the abdomen. The average exposure dose to her abdominal surface in the presence of the lead sheets was 14.05 mGy (range, 13.64-14.34 mGy).\\n12 weeks after the SRS, the patient underwent Caesarean delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without complications. Currently, 7 years after SRS, the child's physical and mental development is normal, and she does not have any other anomalies."}
{"patient_id": "109026", "patient": "A 30-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital with an approximately 12-hour history of oliguria. He was 180 cm tall and weighed 70 kg. The patient and his sister provided the history.\\nTwo days before admission, the patient had orally ingested about 160 mL of enriched diquat (20 g per 100 mL) because of debt-related problems. Three hours later, the patient presented to another hospital for treatment and underwent gastric lavage. At that time, his blood pressure and heart rate were normal, and he had no shortness of breath. His blood creatinine level, routine blood tests, transaminase levels, bilirubin level, coagulation function, troponin level, and electrocardiogram findings were all normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormalities (). The patient refused further treatment and went home on his own. Moreover, a history of systematic disease including hypertension, diabetes, respiratory illness, hepatic or renal dysfunction, and mental disorder was denied by the patient and his family member, as was drug or alcohol abuse. His previous health condition was claimed to be quite good.\\nOne day before admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of our hospital because of pharyngeal pain and mild pain in the upper abdomen. At that time, blood tests showed a high creatinine level (267 μmol/L). The patient was given antioxidation and infusion therapy. However, his urine output decreased and his blood creatinine level increased to 541 μmol/L after 24 hours. The doctor recommended a blood purification treatment. However, the patient and his family refused for economic reasons. Seven hours later, the patient and his family agreed to the blood purification treatment. At that time, the patient’s transaminase and bilirubin levels were elevated. He was transferred to the ICU 57 hours after the oral diquat ingestion and developed kidney failure, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure. He died of respiratory failure on day 13 of hospitalization.\\nDiquat is a small molecular substance with molecular weight of 344.05, and it can easily pass through the cell membrane. Hemoperfusion is an important treatment method in the early stage of diquat poisoning. In the present case, hemoperfusion was performed immediately after admission to the ICU; however, only one 2-hour session of hemoperfusion was performed. Oliguria persisted during hospitalization; therefore, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated following the hemoperfusion treatment. Postdilution continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with an effluent flow of 30 mL/kg of body weight per hour was implemented until the patient died.\\nUpon presentation, the patient was conscious, had no shortness of breath, had a percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), 21%), and had a normal blood pressure and heart rate. His arterial partial pressure of oxygen was acceptable (). Chest CT findings at that time appeared normal (). He was not treated with oxygen therapy because the mechanism of diquat poisoning is mainly the generation of oxygen free radicals leading to cell apoptosis.\\n Although the leukocyte count was high, the procalcitonin (PCT) level was within the low range (). No antimicrobial agent was administered at that time. The patient’s clinical condition rapidly became exacerbated thereafter. On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive shortness of breath and hypoxemia, and his SpO2 was maintained at only about 88% with conservative oxygen therapy. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated when the severe hypoxemia became unacceptable. After endotracheal intubation, piperacillin/tazobactam was empirically given for anti-infective therapy. Fiberbronchoscopy was performed after intubation, and a large amount of yellow plasma exudate was observed. Sputum was collected for culture (). Chest CT examination revealed exudation, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lower lungs, confirming a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (). The patient’s oxygenation significantly improved after he was moved into the prone position; his FiO2 increased to 30% and his SpO2 was maintained at about 90%. On day 6 of hospitalization, another chest CT examination showed that the lung exudation was significantly reduced ().\\nOn day 8, however, the SpO2 began to gradually decline, especially after position changes. The FiO2 had to be increased, and higher inspiratory pressure was required to achieve a satisfactory tidal volume because of deterioration in the respiratory compliance. Deep sedation was required to relieve the sensation of asphyxia. At that time, the previous sputum culture revealed ampicillin-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii. Thus, the treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was continued. On day 10, a bedside chest radiograph showed interstitial lung lesions (). Necrotic mucosal tissue could be seen in the bronchi branches under fiberbronchoscopy. However, the mucosal injury of the oropharynx had healed without mucosal abscission. No plasma exudate was present in the airway, but scattered bleeding was noted after mucosal exfoliation.\\nOn day 12, the patient’s dyspnea was extremely severe, and his autonomic inspiratory drive was so strong that muscle relaxants were required to maintain deep sedation. However, the respiratory compliance was attenuated and the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide increased rapidly as a result. The patient eventually developed severe carbon dioxide retention, respiratory acidosis, and distributed shock (), which led to his death on day 13.\\nWhen the patient was transferred to the ICU, his serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 184 and 275 IU/L, respectively. His total bilirubin level was 60.7 μmol/L, and his direct bilirubin level was 41.0 μmol/L; both decreased slightly after hemoperfusion treatment. Vitamin C, vitamin B6, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and glutathione were intravenously infused for antioxidation. Additionally, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate injection, ademetionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate for injection, and ursodeoxycholic acid capsules were administered for liver protection from the beginning of hospitalization.\\nThe patient’s total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels increased again during CRRT maintenance (). An abdominal CT scan showed no reduction in liver volume on days 3 and 6. However, the prealbumin level was independent of the abnormal liver function. Both the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also normal.\\nThe troponin level was closely monitored after admission, and the troponin I level slightly increased to a maximum of 0.36 ng/mL. In addition, bedside ultrasound monitoring showed no obvious abnormalities in cardiac function."}

Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().\\nThe brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center. One day later, his neurological status deteriorated. The patient died on the fourth day with multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed based on his family’s wishes."}
{"patient_id": "126607", "patient": "A 30-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency room and neurosurgery department with the chief complaints of pain at the right side chest and right side back, which had originated from a rear-end collision car accident that had happened one month before. The patient had been in the passenger's seat during the collision. Though he was given an NSAID, the condition was not improved and he was moved to the pain clinic. His height was 176 cm and his weight was 72 kg. In his medical history, he was announced to be fully recovered from tuberculous pleurisy one year ago, following 14 months of anti-tuberculousis medication. Neither fever nor loss of weight was found recently. The pain was like being stiff and broken, painful even when sitting motionlessly, but more severe during heavy breathing. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was an 8/10 score. According to diagnostic findings, the pain pattern was like putting a belt around the skin segment corresponding to the 9th thoracic vertebra. No special finding was discovered except the tender point located at the right side rib, which fell on the 10th rib. According to the plain X-ary of the chest region at that time, the finding was an old fibrocalcific tuberculosis scar involving both upper lobe apexes. The simple X-ray findings were normal at the thoracic vertebra and ribs (). The laboratory test results were WBC 6,980/mm3, ESR 18 mm/hr, CRP 14.97 mg/dl, total protein 7.92 g/dl, and albumin 4.51 g/dl. Since continued medication and injection at the tender point had no effect, an epidural block and intercostal block were performed suspecting sprain from experience, but no improvement was found. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the thoracic vertebra region for a differential diagnosis showed an abnormal signal at the ninth thoracic vertebral body (). From the computed tomography (CT) result, trabeculae thickening, loss of tubular shape, and reduced bone density were found heterogeneously, as well as a seemingly abnormal fracture with the fracture line at the upper plate (). Suspecting a metastatic spine tumor, such as hemangioma or metastasis of a malignant tumor, the patient was transferred to the Oncology department and additional tests were performed. According to the bone scanning, extensive absorption increase at the 9th thoracic vertebra, and absorption increase at the 6th and 10th right ribs were found. A positron emission tomography (PET) showed FDG (fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose) absorption increase at the 9th thoracic vertebral body and the 10th right rib. To check for the existence of other malignant tumors, lung computed tomography and blood tests, including a tumor maker and endoscope in the stomach and large intestine, were performed with no specific findings. Moreover, the AIDS test results were negative, the AFB (acid fast bacillus) smear test was negative, the MTB PCR was positive, and the AFB culture test was negative. By reviewing the biopsy, chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis and multinucleated giant cells were found, so that the tuberculous spondylitis diagnosis was confirmed (). At present, the patient is visiting the Department of Internal Medicine and being given anti-tuberculosis agents and NSAID. The pain is maintained at the level of VAS 3-4/10 score."}
{"patient_id": "75709", "patient": "Thirty-eight-year-old woman with 162 cm height and 76 kg weight was admitted to our outpatient clinic with the complaint of renal colic. She had a history of renal stone diseases for 6 times in the last 6 months with 20–40 days of intermittences. Her stones were white in color and they were easily dispersible with a diameter of 3–5 mm approximately (). She had collected her stones and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to the stones for the analysis (). The results of the analysis revealed that 45.1% of the stones were aluminum hydroxide and 44.9% were carbonate apatite and protein. Metabolic investigations were made both in serum and 24-hour urine in order to determine the etiology of stone (). Serum aluminum was determined as 32 μg/L (1–14) and calcium was 9.87 mg/dL (8.8–10.2), while urinary calcium excretion was 0.38 g/day (0.1–0.3). In her history it was determined that she was using a roll-on deodorant that was containing aluminum. After 2-month period of dismissing this deodorant, her serum aluminum level was 12 μg/L (1–14) and her urinary aluminum excretion was in normal limits (3.67 μg/day, reference range: <50).\\nShe was evaluated with urinary ultrasound and tomography for the presence of stone disease and they were all normal. In approximately 5 months of follow-up, she did not have any renal colic attacks."}
{"patient_id": "162439", "patient": "A 73-year old male patient of 173 cm height and 52 kg weight visited hospital. The chief complaint was cellulitis in right ankle. He was under medication after being diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and left chronic tuberculous empyema ten years ago. He was undergoing hemodialysis three times a week after diagnosis of end-stage renal disease eight years previously. There were no specific findings during the hospital stay. He maintained normal blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and heart rate of 65-80 beats per minute. Atrial fibrillation, normal left ventricular function, moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and moderate pericardial effusion were observed in echocardiography () performed during his hospital stay. Left lung empyema, right pleural effusion, pericardial effusion were confirmed by chest CT scans () and simple chest X-rays () and pulmonary function test showed a moderate restrictive pattern. Hemodialysis was performed the day before the operation and the result of the complete blood count before hemodialysis were hemoglobin level 8.8 g/dl.\\nOn the fourth day of his in-hospital stay, sudden respiratory distress occurred after performing needle aspiration test of the right pleural effusion. Despite taking a simple chest X-ray immediately, our medical staff could not find any cause and observed him with oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Respiratory distress got worse at a respiratory rate of 30 times per minute and an oxygen saturation level of 85% with changing mental status. Our staff inserted right chest tube 2 hours 30 minutes after performing needle aspiration biopsy. Approximately 1,500 ml of blood was drained for about 10 minutes after chest tube insertion, with blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 times per minute, and body temperature of 36.4℃. Rapid fluid replacement with 1L of normal saline via central venous catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein was performed and an emergency operation was decided upon. The patient's electronic medical record (EMR) was unidentifiable by anesthesiologists because of computer network error at that time. Hence, the emergency operation was began only by acknowledging that the patient with diabetes and hypertension was receiving hemodialysis and massive bleeding occurred during needle aspiration test at right pleura.\\nHe was transferred to the operating room without any preoperative medication 20 minutes after chest tube insertion. At that time, his vital signs were blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 times per minute, and body temperature of 34.9℃. He was stuperous and his skin was cold but other physical examination could not be performed. Preoxygenation was attempted with 100% oxygen at 8 L/min via mask and warm Voluven® (6% hydroxyethyl starch, Fresenius Kabi, Germany) was rapidly administered. In addition, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored. An arterial catheter for continuous hemodynamic monitoring was placed via the right femoral artery and a central venous catheter via the right femoral vein and 500 ml of Voluven® was rapidly administered. After IV administration of 90 mg ketamine and 50 mg rocuronium for induction, endotracheal intubation was performed with a 35 Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath®, Mallinckrodt Medical Athlone, Ireland) and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (LF-GP, Olympus, Japan) was used for confirmation of proper placement. During lung ventilation, tidal volume of 100-120 ml, a peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg, a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and a central venous pressure of 17-18 mmHg in supine position was checked. We attempted to maintain anesthesia with 1.5 L/min of oxygen, 1.5 L/min of nitrous oxide, and 2 vol% of sevoflurane. However, inspired oxygen concentration was changed to 100%, sevoflurane administration was stopped, and 1 mg of midazolam was administered intravenously every 15 minutes after oxygen saturation fell to 84%. After the patient was changed to left-sided lateral position, the location of tube was confirmed by a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope with a central venous pressure of 21 mmHg. Left one-lung ventilation (OLV) was performed five minutes after changing the position to left-sided lateral position. Tidal volume and oxygen saturation decreased to 170-180 ml and 80% respectively. Peak inspiratory pressure increased up to 38 cmH2O.\\nImmediately on opening the right pleural cavity via right posterolateral thoracotomy, blood pressure decreased catastrophically and 1,500 ml of blood gushed out of the pleural cavity followed by about additional 1,200 ml of blood loss. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed 25 minutes after the beginning of surgery (). Subsequently, 3 L of Voluven® and 1 L of normal saline were administered rapidly during the half an hour after the beginning of surgery. At half an hour after the beginning of surgery, our hospital computer network was restored; packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were administered. Then central venous pressure increased up to 38 mmHg with decreased active bleeding, fluid administration was minimized for concern about volume overload. Oxygen saturation level decreased continuously even though peak inspiratory pressure was above 40 cmH2O during one-lung ventilation. One-lung and two-lung ventilation were performed in turn along with manual and mechanical ventilation by maintaining tidal volume of 120 ml, respiratory rate of 60-70 times per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, inhaled oxygen concentration of 100%, and oxygen saturation of 91-93%. Although fluid administration was minimized, central venous pressure increased up to 50 mmHg, blood pressure and heart rate were maintained at 120/60 mmHg and 67 beats per minute respectively and there were no abnormal ECG finding. Initial blood loss via chest tube before surgery was 1,500 ml, estimated blood loss during operation was 2,700 ml for 40 minutes and there was no urine output. The patient was administered 4,000 ml of Voluven®, 2,000 ml of normal saline, 5 pints of packed RBCs, and 5 pints of fresh frozen plasma. At 45 minutes after the beginning of surgery, central venous pressure suddenly increased up to 58 mmHg with falling in blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, bradycardia of 25-30 beats per minute. 0.5 mg of atropine and 0.5 mg of epinephrine were administered immediately through a central line and the pericardium was checked by the surgeon for suspected pericardial tamponade while resuscitation was being prepared. The surgeon confirmed pericardial expansion and made a pericardial window immediately. After approximately 800 ml of yellow serous fluid with no blood was drained from the pericardial space, vital signs stabilized with recovering heart rate 60 beats per minute. Thereafter, blood pressure of 115/50 mmHg and heart rate of 65 beats per minute were maintained and central venous pressure was reduced to 45 mmHg. To maintain blood pressure, 20 mg of ephedrine and 1 g of calcium gluconate were administered divided. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed 30 minutes after pericardial window (). Although no active bleeding focus was found in the surgical field, blood leak continued under the damaged diaphragm. It was decided to observe the patient in the intensive care unit after primary closure. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed postoperatively and a small fresh blood clot was detected at the right bronchus. The patient was transferred to the ICU while maintaining a double lumen endotracheal tube from concern about failure of finding the bleeding focus and the risk of rebleeding. The total amount of fluid administrated during surgery was 4,100 ml of Voluven®, 3,000 ml of normal saline, 7 pints of packed RBCs, and 5 pints of fresh frozen plasma. Blood loss before surgery was 1,500 ml and intraoperative blood loss was 2,700 ml. Upon arrival on the ICU, the patient was stable with blood pressure of 97/72 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute and a tympanic membrane temperature of 35.7℃. No pulmonary edema was observed on postoperative chest X-ray (). Hemoperitoneum was confirmed on abdominal CT scan but we decided to observe carefully because there was no active bleeding focus in the abdominal cavity on the celiac artery angiogram. The patient exhibited stable vital signs after continuous renal replacement therapy during follow-up period and about 900 ml of bleeding via chest tube occurred on the first postoperative day. However, the chest tube was removed and hemoperitoneum was resolved as bleeding diminished 10 days postoperatively. Moderate pericardial effusion was detected again on echocardiography. The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure."}
{"patient_id": "124102", "patient": "A 20-year-old Japanese female student was admitted to Toyonaka Municipal Hospital in 2006 in order to undergo examinations, including renal biopsy, because she was found to have chance proteinuria and hematuria at the health surveillance in her university. On admission, she was 171 cm tall and weighed 68.1 kg. Her blood pressure was 124/90 mm Hg and her pulse rate was 75/min with no arrhythmia. No abnormal finding was identified by physical examination. Her laboratory findings are described in Table . Significant proteinuria and hematuria with hypoalbuminemia were recognized, but the criteria for nephrotic syndrome were not satisfied. Other values, including lipids and renal functions, were within normal ranges.\\nOn renal biopsy, more than 30 glomeruli were contained in LM specimens, some of which showed global sclerotic change. Neither mesangial cell proliferation nor mesangial matrix expansion was marked (Fig. ). In silver methenamine-stained sections, “spike” formation as seen in MN was found in most of the glomeruli (Fig. ). Foam cells were not found in any glomeruli, but in the interstitial area. On IF staining, very weak linear patterns were identified for IgG and C3 in glomeruli, but a granular pattern as seen in MN was not identified (data not shown). EM study showed highly dense deposits in the subepithelial, subendothelial, and mesangial areas, which appeared like microbubbles or microcysts on higher magnification (Fig. ).\\nBased on the renal histological findings, in spite of the almost negative results on IF study, MN was diagnosed, and treatment with prednisolone and cyclosporine A was started. The combination of 2 immunosuppressive agents initially seemed effective because of decreased urinary protein. When the dosages were gradually lowered, however, urinary protein was persistent between 0.5 and 2.5 g/gCr. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was slowly reduced but became stable at around 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 after 5 years of the first biopsy. Mild anemia was observed initially, and the hemoglobin level further decreased corresponding with the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. After the administration of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, however, it was more than 10 g/dL.\\nAlthough serum triglycerides and cholesterol were within normal limits (Table ), the plasma ApoE concentration was high (LCAT: 82 nmol/mL; ApoA1: 187 mg/dL; ApoA2: 32.1 mg/dL; ApoB: 52 mg/dL; ApoE: 10.4 mg/dL). Since this finding suggested an ApoE abnormality, the ApoE phenotype, genotype, and ApoE DNA sequence of the patient were examined.\\nPlasma ApoE phenotypes were analyzed by isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis, as previously reported [, ]. The patient's sample showed the position of ApoE2/2 (Fig. ).\\nThe ApoE genotype was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, as described previously [, ]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were digested with the restriction enzyme HhaI. Genotype ε2/2 in the patient was identified by 91- and 83-bp fragments (Fig. ). The ApoE Toyonaka (Ser197Cys), as shown in Figure , was also confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis digested with SacI (Fig. ). Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, sense 5′-CGTGCGGGCCGCCACTGTGAGCT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCGCATGGCTGCAGGCTTCGGCGTTC-3′. The 335-bp fragment after cleavage by SacI suggested normal c.644C of ApoE in codon 197 (Fig. ). The 358- and 335-bp fragments after cleavage by SacI showed a heterozygous novel mutation of ApoE Toyonaka (Fig. ).\\nSequencing of ApoE DNA was performed as described previously []. As a result, in our patient, we identified a homozygous polymorphism at codon 158 (ε2/2: c.526 C>T: Arg158Cys) (data not shown) and a heterozygous missense mutation (C to G) in exon 4 leading to an amino acid substitution Cys (TGC) for Ser (TCC) at codon 197 (c.644 C>G: p.S215C: Ser197Cys) (Fig. ).\\nThe first biopsy showed MN-like findings, but immune deposits were not proven there, and immune-genetic MN was doubtful. Meanwhile, the gene examination for ApoE revealed the coexistence of ApoE Toyonaka and ApoE2/2, suggesting the involvement of a new form of ApoE-related disease. To clarify the accurate pathological changes, a second renal biopsy was conducted 9 years after the first one. Although the histological findings by LM and IF were similar to those of the first biopsy, the density of deposits on EM were more obvious, and ApoE was identified by immunohistochemical studies for LM and EM specimens using anti-ApoE antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) (Fig. ) [].\\nIn order to determine the glomerular deposits, an analysis by means of liquid chromatography-assisted MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) of glomeruli obtained from both renal biopsies using laser capture microdissection method was performed as previously reported []. In brief, glomeruli in a 10-μm-thick section of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue stained with hematoxylin were microdissected with laser microdissection (PALM MicroBeam, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Ten glomeruli were analyzed for each specimen. Microdissected fragments were digested into peptides using trypsin and analyzed on amazon ETD (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) using LC-MS/MS. Peptides present in raw data files were queried by the use of Mascot and X!Tandem, the results were then assigned peptide and protein probability scores, and they were displayed by the use of Scaffold software (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). As a result, the most abundant protein was ApoE in both samples (Fig. )."}
{"patient_id": "11578", "patient": "A 58-year-old female (height 170 cm, body weight 65 kg, body surface area 1.7 cm2) presented to the outside hospital’s emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and “hot flashes”. Her past medical history was significant for a pituitary adenoma, which had been resected two years prior. Electrocardiogram (EKG) on presentation showed sinus bradycardia (55 beats per min) with frequent premature ventricular ectopy and prolonged QT intervals (550 msec). Echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction 10% with right ventricular dysfunction. She underwent cardiac catheterization and no significant coronary disease was identified. Cardiac index was measured at 1.2 L/min/kg and, as a result, she was placed on norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions for hemodynamic support. During catheterization, the patient acutely decompensated, developing hypoxia and mental status change. Arterial blood gas drawn at the outside hospital recorded a PaO2 of 37 mmHg with O2 saturation 69% on a non-rebreathing facemask. She required emergent intubation and was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) at the outside institution for further management. While in the CCU, she continued to develop unstable ventricular tachycardia refractory to medical management, including the administration of multiple anti-arrhythmic medications and defibrillation. She was hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure of 55 mmHg, requiring high dose of norepinephrine (0.6 mic/kg/min) and dobutamine (10 mic/kg/min). She was also hypoxic requiring 100% FiO2 to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation. Due to hemodynamic instability, she was placed on VA-ECMO via bilateral groin access and transferred to our institution for further management.\\nRepeated echo at our institution showed cardiac standstill (Video ).\\nA routine admission laboratory panel revealed hypocalcemia, elevated lactate, hyperglycemia with a normal renal and hepatic functions (Table ). Shortly after admission, she was noted to be producing large amounts of urine. Her urine output was measured at 8 liters over the first 12 hours at our institution. Initially, VA-ECMO flow was restricted to 2-2.4 L/min, most likely due to hypovolemia. Aggressive fluid replacement therapy was initiated and ECMO flow improved to 4.5 L/min. A subsequent endocrine panel was abnormal (Table ).\\nEndocrine and nephrology were consulted to assist with the diagnosis and treatment plan. Based on the history of pituitary resection, as well as the discovery that the patient was noncompliant with her medications for approximately six months prior to presentation, it was believed her numerous endocrine abnormalities and cardiogenic shock were secondary to acute panhypopituitarism. Initial treatment included intravenous fluid replacement for central diabetes insipidus, intravenous levothyroxine for hypothyroidism (50 mcg daily), corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency (100 mg every eight hours), and calcium replacement (1000 mg three times a day). As her fluid balance normalized, her lactic acidosis eventually resolved.\\nAfter three days of ECMO support and medical treatment, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed improving left and right ventricular function. An ECMO weaning trial with decreased ECMO flow was conducted on ECMO day 4 and she was decannulated from ECMO support on ECMO day 5. Inotropic support was not required after post-decannulation. Echocardiography after ECMO removal showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% and normal right ventricular function (Video ).\\nAfter being successfully weaned from ECMO therapy, the patient was transitioned to oral prednisone (5 mg daily) for adrenal insufficiency, oral levothyroxine (100 mcg daily) for hypothyroidism, and intravenous calcitriol (1 mcg daily) and oral calcium carbonate (1,000 mg three times daily) for hypocalcemia. She was extubated and liberated from mechanical ventilation on post-decannulation day 3. She was then transferred back to the referral facility on post-decannulation day 7 and eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility and home without recurrence of heart failure symptoms."}

Though he had fallen off the board into the water once, there was no impact trauma. First, he developed acute, severe pain in his back with a tingling sensation in his lower extremities and progressive weakness within half an hour. He was taken to the local emergency room, where he presented with complete paraplegia with absence of bladder function. He decided to transfer to our hospital. Physical evaluation showed that his lower extremity strength was 3/3. Both paresthesia and hypoesthesia below the level of the umbilicus were noted. Proprioception of the big toes was intact. Perianal sensation was decreased and urinary retention was present. Bulbocavernosus reflex was intact. He underwent MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine without contrast, which showed increased T2 signal intensity in the gray matter of the central spinal cord from T10 to the conus (); otherwise, MRI was negative for structural lesions including disc herniation, fractures, spondylosis, or vascular lesions. Laboratory tests were within normal limits. Considering his clinical history as a first time surfer, the patient was suspected of having surfer’s myelopathy. He was admitted to the department of neurosurgery, and we focused on maintaining the degree of hypertension (average mean arterial blood pressure >85 mmHg) and did not administer steroids. His motor grade of the lower extremities recovered to 4+/4+, and he was able to ambulate with assistance the day after admission; however, there was little improvement in paresthesia and hypoesthesia. The next day, he transferred to his hometown hospital to be close to his parents. One month after the event, he recovered his strength to almost normal levels with intact bladder function and improved sensory deficit."}

He was able to lift limbs but was unable to walk or dress himself. The weakness persisted and remained the same until the time of admission five hours later. Weakness was symmetrical and nonprogressive and involved all four limbs. There was no pain, numbness, or abnormal movements in limbs. Swallowing and breathing were not impaired. Urinary and faecal incontinence were absent.\\nPatient's past medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and systolic heart failure. Home medications included Mixtard 18 U mane and 8 U vesper, Losartan 50 mg twice daily, Nifedipine 20 mg twice daily, Spironolactone 50 mg daily, Frusemide 40 mg daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and Amiodarone 100 mg daily. Dietary history revealed that he was drinking king coconut water 2–4 servings almost every day for past one week.\\nHe was overweight (height: 166 cm, weight: 70 kg, BMI: 25.4 kg/m2). Xanthelasma and arcus senilis were present. He had elevated blood pressure (140/90) with cardiac apex lying in 6th intercostal space. Examination of limbs revealed symmetrical weakness with more distal involvement (proximal 4/5, distal 3/5). Limb reflexes were not impaired except for absent bilateral ankle jerks. Impaired sensation of pain and temperature was present in a glove and stocking type distribution. Joint position sensation was diminished in both upper and lower limbs. Examination of central nervous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems was normal.\\nInvestigations revealed renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 3.66 mg/dl-, eGFR: 15 ml/min, blood urea: 20.32 mmol/l, and arterial blood HCO3−: 12.7 meq/l). He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium: 7.02 mmol/l) with electrocardiogram showing tall, tented T waves and sine waves. Serum sodium was 129 meq/l. Renal ultrasound showed increased cortical echogenicity and impaired corticomedullary demarcation. Noncontrast computerized tomography of brain revealed normal findings. Electromyogram did not reveal acute radiculopathy, plexopathy, or myopathy. Nerve conduction studies revealed distal segmental axonal neuropathy suggestive of diabetic polyneuropathy.\\nStandard ward protocol for managing hyperkalemia was followed. Patient was initially given IV 10% calcium gluconate 10 ml over 10 minutes followed by a repeat dose. Spironolactone and Losartan were immediately withheld. He was given IV 50% Dextrose 50 ml with 10 U of Soluble Insulin. Patient was nebulized with Salbutamol 5 ml over 10 minutes and it was repeated twice. The interventions showed biochemical and electrocardiographic improvement in two hours (serum potassium: 6.1 meq/l). He was commenced on calcium resonium 15 g three times daily.

{"patient_id": "132842", "patient": "A 14-year-old Caucasian male presented for endocrine evaluation of poor growth and pubertal delay. He was the youngest of three children born to a nonconsanguineous couple. The family history was notable for delayed puberty in both parents. The mother reported having menarche at age of 15 while the father indicated he developed later than his peers having experienced his growth spurt at approximately age of 16. The mother received fertility treatment for her first pregnancy, yet subsequently conceived twice spontaneously with uneventful pregnancies and deliveries. The parents were otherwise healthy, with normal height (father: +1.08 standard deviation score [SDS], mother: +0.21 SDS) and no dysmorphic features. The patient was born at 41 weeks gestation (birth weight 3,350 g (-0.13 SDS); length 50 cm (-0.05 SDS); Apgar scores: 8/8/8). Bilateral choanal atresia was suspected clinically in the first days of life and mixed (fibrotic and osseous) choanal atresia (predominantly fibrotic) was confirmed via computed tomography (CT) imaging (). Endoscopic laser surgery was performed at 5 days of life with serial surgical interventions at 1 month and 3.5 months. Panendoscopy did not reveal any additional anomalies and ultrasound revealed normal urinary tract structures without visceral malformation. He achieved global developmental milestones within expected timeframes yet he did not begin walking until 18 months. Interestingly, the parents retrospectively reported that he often appeared to struggle with balance during infancy. At 3.8 years he underwent unilateral surgical repair of an inguinal hernia. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable. He reported a reduced sense of smell that had never been formally investigated. Pubarche was noted at age of 13. Charting his growth did not reveal any deflection as both height and weight parameters were between -1.5 and -2 SDS since the age of 5.\\nIn the first visit in our clinic at 13.5 years, his height (Holter Stadiometer) was 139.9 cm (-2.04 SDS) and weight was 30.0 kg (-1.74 SDS). He exhibited normal segmental proportions (arm span: 138 cm, upper versus lower segment: 0 SDS). Clinical evaluation revealed a left low-set ear with helix anteversion and an ogival palate (with presence of a dental apparatus). The patient was unvirilized with Tanner A1 P2 G1 with prepubertal testes (2 mL bilaterally by Prader orchidometer) and micropenis (4 cm×1 cm; reference range, 5.5–12.8 cm []).\\nAt 14 years, growth velocity was slow at 3.1 cm/yr (-2 SDS) and bone age was delayed by 2.5 years compared to chronological age, consistent with his lack of pubertal development. Formal smell testing (\"Burghart Sniffin' Sticks Identification Test 16\") confirmed anosmia (score 5/16, <5th percentile). Basal serum hormone profiling indicated prepubertal serum testosterone (0.2 nmol/L [0.1–1.0 {T1} via liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy, LC-MS/MS]) in the setting of low gonadotropins (LH: 0.5 U/L [0.5–2.5 {G1}]), FSH: 1.3 U/L (<3 [G1]) via the Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Normal basal hormonal levels suggested intact thyrotrope, corticotrope and somatotrope axes (). Sertoli-cell function, as assessed by AMH (443.6 pmol/L [5–800 pmol/L]) and Inhibin B (86.4 pg/mL [35–182 pg/mL]), was normal for his prepubertal stage. There was no evidence of any chronic disease or functional causes for his hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism ().\\nThe constellation of choanal atresia, anosmia, mild dysmorphic features, micropenis and delayed puberty were suggestive of CHARGE syndrome. After obtaining informed consent from the patient and his family, Sanger sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood. The patient was found to harbor a heterozygous CHD7 mutation (c.4234T>G [p.Tyr1412Asp]). This is a private variant, not seen in large control databases such as the 1,000 Genomes or ExAC. Structural modelling revealed that the Tyr residue at position 1412 is located in the core of the helicase C domain, and the change to an Asp is predicted to have a major detrimental effect on the structural stability of CHD7 as a large buried hydrophobic amino acid is replaced by a small charged hydrophilic one (). This variant is predicted to be deleterious by both sorting intolerant from tolerant-Algorithm and PolyPhen-2. The mutation was not detected in his parents, and is therefore a de novo mutation. Subsequent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal lateral and posterior semicircular canals () with vestibular and cochlear malformation (). Additional findings included a verticalized sella turcica, a decreased hypophyseal volume (160 mm3) for his age (), hypoplastic gyri, deformed left VII cranial nerve, right olfactive bulb aplasia and left olfactive bulb hypoplasia (). Echocardiography did not reveal any cardiac malformation and echocardiogram was normal. The ophthalmologic investigation was within normal limits, notably without coloboma. Vestibular function assessment showed normal utricular (subjective vertical testing and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential [VEMP] test) and saccular function (cervical-VEMP). The video head impulse test used to identify peripheral vestibular deficits revealed posterior and lateral semicircular canal dysfunctions on both sides, consistent with the anomalies found on the MRI. Audiometry was normal. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone stimulation testing () triggered only minor increase in LH and FSH (8.3 mU/L and 4.4 mU/L, respectively, LH:FSH ratio 1.88). Bone densitometry via dual X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA-210430) showed normal bone density for his bone age (Lumbar spine z-score: -1.7 SDS) according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry references. No neuropsychological evaluation was performed as our patient followed normal educational track without notable difficulty.\\nBased on these findings and the Verloes' 2005 Criteria [], the patient was diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome. Specifically, he exhibited 2 major criteria (choanal atresia and hypoplastic semicircular canals) and 2 minor criteria (hypothalamohypophyseal dysfunction/gonadotropin deficiency and abnormal external/middle ear) (). Low dose testosterone (50 mg via intramuscular injection monthly) was initiated at 14.6 years and improved growth velocity (from 3 to 9 cm/yr) and development of secondary sexual characteristics. No significant testicular enlargement was observed during this treatment and pubertal induction is ongoing."}

The diagnostic work-up, including axial abdominal imaging, revealed a 9-cm mass in the body of the pancreas involving the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV). The biopsy of the mass was consistent with pancreatoblastoma (PB). The patient received neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy with partial response. Two years later, at another center, he underwent surgical resection with a pylorus-sparing pancreato-duodenectomy including resection of the involved SMV and SMA. The reconstruction of the SMA required the use of an autologous saphenous vein graft from the aorta. Histological examination of the resected mass confirmed PB measuring 5×4.5×4.5 cm with perineural and peripancreatic invasion and infiltration of 1/16 peripancreatic lymph nodes. The margins of the excised SMA were negative. The patient’s coagulation profile was significant for factor V Leiden mutation heterozygosity (R506Q) and lupus anticoagulant positivity. The post-operative course was complicated by mesenteric ischemia with marked leukocytosis, acidosis, and severe hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic support. On post-operative day 12, the patient required re-operation and underwent sub-total enterectomy for small intestine necrosis secondary to thrombosis of the saphenous vein graft. The length of the residual small intestine consisted of 22 cm of proximal jejunum (stapled off) and 68 cm of distal ileum (mucous fistula) in continuity with the colon (). The foregut was decompressed via gastro-jejunostomy tube and the bilio-pancreatic tract was diverted with percutaneous trans-hepatic external drainage. Total parenteral nutrition was initiated and the patient was referred to our center for intestinal transplantation. At the time of referral, the patient’s serum total bilirubin level was 11.8 (direct 8.2) mg/dL; liver biopsy demonstrated cholestasis and stage II fibrosis, consistent with parenteral-nutrition-associated liver disease.\\nDuring the evaluation for candidacy to intestinal transplantation, attempts were made at resuming enteral nutrition via a feeding tube through the residual ileum. These attempts failed due to chronic stricturing of the ileum secondary to previous ischemic insults. In addition, ischemic strictures at the level of the ascending colon were detected on barium enema. An extensive malignancy workup, including whole-body nuclear scan revealed multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue foci within the abdomen around the aorta, in the supraclavicular and inguinal lymph nodes, and one hypermetabolic focus within the liver, suggestive of metastatic PB. Multiple attempts to characterize these lesions with CT-guided biopsy were inconclusive. Therefore, the patient underwent a staging laparotomy. In addition, the laparotomy was aimed to determine the viability of the residual small and large intestine for potential restoration of the gastrointestinal continuity and resumption of enteral nutrition. No macroscopic evidence of PB was found intra-operatively; biopsies taken from mesenteric and peri-aortic lymph nodes as well as the liver, were negative for malignancy. The residual proximal jejunum appeared viable and was decompressed with creation of a high jejunostomy. Unlike the jejunum, the distal ileum and the ascending colon appeared chronically strictured at multiple levels and were resected. As a result, the residual short gut was not reconstructable rendering the patient totally dependent on parenteral nutrition with no potential for intestinal rehabilitation. Having excluded, to the best of the available diagnostic accuracy, the presence of residual or recurrent PB and having completed the pre-transplantation evaluation, as per our protocol, the patient was added to the wait-list for multi-visceral transplantation. While on the wait-list, the patient suffered multiple catheter-related blood stream infections and repeated episodes of acute kidney injury requiring admission to the intensive care unit and ultimately developed end-stage kidney failure requiring hemodialysis.\\nFourteen months after listing, the patient underwent multi-visceral and kidney transplantation. The donor was a blood-type O 15-year-old female with weight of 61 kg, height 173 cm, and BMI of 20 kg/m2 who suffered brain death following a head trauma from motor vehicle accident. The donor was hemodynamically stable with no acidosis and normal liver and kidney function. The abdominal organs were free from injury. We recovered an en-bloc multi-visceral graft consisting of liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, small intestine, and large intestine up to the distal transverse colon. The left kidney was recovered from the same donor as well.\\nAfter completion of the recipient’s native enterectomy, hepatectomy and pancreatectomy, the multi-visceral graft was transplanted as previously described []; the kidney graft was transplanted intra-peritoneally to the right iliac fossa with standard technique (). The arterial inflow to the multi-visceral graft consisted of two separate end-to-end anastomoses between the celiac trunk and the SMA of the recipient and of the graft, respectively (). Due to the small abdominal domain, the abdomen was closed with biologic mesh in order to avoid increased intra-abdominal pressure. Induction immunosuppression consisted of anti-IL-2R antibodies; maintenance immunosuppression was with tacrolimus and corticosteroids. The post-transplantation monitoring with ileoscopy and biopsy was unremarkable with no rejection episodes and normal kidney graft function. The post-transplantation course was uneventful with excellent graft function and the patient was discharged home on post-operative day 27. At five years post-transplantation, the patient is disease-free with normal graft function on low dose maintenance immunosuppression."}
{"patient_id": "18479", "patient": "The mother of patients II-1 and II-3 is a 43-year-old female who is a child of non-consanguineous parents (Fig. , individual I-2). During puberty she wore an orthopaedic corset due to a spine deformation and an orthopaedic pad for a shorter right leg. Regular menses started at age of 16 years. At the age of 40 years her head circumference was 52 cm (3rd centile), her height was 149 cm, her weight was 52 kg, and her BMI was 23. She was found to have intellectual disability, coarse facial features, hypotelorism, irregular posture, and wide chest. She suffers from frequent back pain, which spreads to both legs. She was diagnosed with arterial hypertension, second degree blood pressure increase, hypertensive cardiopathy (impaired diastolic function, moderate risk group), and a small haemodynamically insignificant atrial septal defect. An audiogram showed a neurosensory hearing impairment. An inner organ ultrasound revealed gall bladder stones. A spinal MRI performed at the age of 41 showed straightened lordosis, first degree spondylolystesis of L5, spondylolysis, first degree deforming osteochondrosis in the lower part of the thoracic spine and L1–5, second-third degree deforming osteochondrosis in the L5–S1 vertebrae, and Th12–L1 partial stenosis and L5–S1 absolute stenosis of the spinal canal. The patient’s IQ was measured at age 42 using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III []: total IQ 62, verbal IQ 61, non-verbal IQ 69."}
{"patient_id": "15569", "patient": "A 45-year-old-woman (height 162.9 cm, weight 44.5 kg) was admitted with complaints of twice-daily headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, obstipation over several days, and excretion of only a small amount of aqueous stool in spite of enema administrations. She had a medical history of lip mucosal neuroma resection at the age of 6, total thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma at the age of 14, and right and left adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma at the ages of 25 and 27, respectively. She had received follow-up on suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. Physical examination revealed that the abdomen was soft but bulging, with weakened intestinal peristaltic sound. Blood pressure was 110–150/60–90 mmHg, heart rate was 90–120 beats/min in sinus rhythm, and body temperature was 36.8 °C. Subsequent 24-h urine collection for catecholamines revealed elevated metanephrine levels of 0.4 [normal range (NR) 0.04–0.19] μg/day, normetanephrine levels of 0.4 (NR 0.09–0.33) μg/day, dopamine levels of 3241.8 (NR 365.0–961.5) μg/day, adrenaline levels of 40.7 (NR 3.4–26.9) mg/day, and noradrenaline levels of 253.1 (NR 48.6–168.4) mg/day. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy showed a 17 × 15 mm mass accumulation on the left side of the inferior vena cava (Fig. ). X-ray and computed tomography of the abdomen showed remarkably distended colon with the maximal diameter of 12.6 cm and colon gas, which were consistent with the patient’s symptoms (Fig. a). She was diagnosed with local recurrence of pheochromocytoma and scheduled for laparoscopic tumor resection. For preoperative preparation, several strategies for reduction of intra-intestinal pressure were initiated, which included fasting, 2000 ml/day of fluid replacement, oral administration of α1-adrenergic receptor blocker, doxazosin (1 mg/day), and intravenous administration of the nonselective α-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine (1.5 mg/h). Furthermore, lower intestinal endoscopy showed a large amount of fecal mass and enema were performed. However, despite all those interventions, defecation was difficult and neither intra-intestinal pressure reduction nor symptomatic relief was achieved.\\nWe selected general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia for perioperative management of this patient. An epidural catheter was placed between the ninth and tenth thoracic vertebra, and its efficacy was confirmed by administration of a combination of 8 ml of 2% mepivacaine and 100 μg of fentanyl before induction of anesthesia. In addition to standard monitors, invasive arterial pressure via radial artery and stroke volume index (SVI) and stroke volume variation (SVV) with the use of the FloTrac™-EV1000™ system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) were monitored. The induction was uneventful with 2 μg/kg of fentanyl, 2 mg/kg of propofol, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium under reverse Trendelenburg position and pressured cricothyroid cartilage. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (0.5–0.7 MAC), remifentanil (0.15–0.4 μg/kg/min), and 0.25% levobupivacaine (5 ml/h) via epidural catheter. Although hemodynamic fluctuations occurred during manipulation of the tumor, the patient was successfully managed with bolus infusions of phenylephrine (0.1 mg), nicardipine (0.2 mg), and landiolol (2.5 mg); neither of continuous infusion of vasodilators nor catecholamines was needed. Intraoperative fluid infusion was titrated to maintain SVI values between 40 and 80 ml/m2/beat and SVV between 5 and 10%. For postoperative analgesia, intravenous acetaminophen (700 mg) was administered and continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine (5 ml/h) was initiated at the end of surgery.\\nPostoperative pain was well controlled with continuous epidural infusion of local anesthetics and regular administration of acetaminophen. On the second postoperative day, the numerical pain rating scale was almost 1 and the epidural catheter was removed. Acetaminophen was continued postoperatively for 1 week. Regarding the patient’s postoperative symptoms, although headache and nausea were gradually relieved, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and defecation difficulties continued over several weeks postoperatively (Fig. b), which required several stool suction treatments by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Finally, the patient was able to resume oral intake on the 22nd postoperative day."}

Examination of genitalia revealed well-developed labia majora, clitoris, and poorly developed labia minora and 4 cm deep blind ended vagina []. Urethral orifice and anus were normal. Examination of the right inguinal region revealed 3 × 2 cm oval firm mass in inguinal canal and in the left inguinal region similar mass was felt at the level of internal inguinal ring.\\nUltrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the absence of uterus and bilateral ovaries. Ultrasound examination of the inguinal region revealed well-defined, 3 × 2 cm oval masses bilaterally and echo texture of the masses were like that of testis. MRI scanning of the pelvis revealed normal-sized testes bilaterally in the inguinal canals []. Uterus and ovaries were not visualized. Karyotyping revealed a 46 × Y pattern []. Her FSH was 4.19 mlU/ml (reference range for normal adult male: 1-12 mlU/ml), LH was 20.7 mlU/ml (reference range 2–12 mlU/ml), serum testosterone was 321.64 ng/dl (Reference range 300-1000 ng/dl for normal adult male) and Estradiol was 53.36 pg/ml.\\nAfter standard preoperative preparation, operative laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Pelvic and abdominal inspection revealed no internal genitalia except bilateral gonads appearing as testis located in the inguinal canals at the level of internal inguinal ring []. The pedicles of the gonads were coagulated with bipolar diathermy and cut with laparoscopic scissors. To prevent the spillage of cells and contamination, gonads were placed in endobags and removed intact after extending the port []. No complications occurred during the operation. The patient was discharged on the following day after surgery.\\nThe histopathological examination of the gonads revealed thickened tunica albuginea, seminiferous tubules with primary and secondary spermatogonia and sertoli cells. Intertubular leydig cells were seen along with peritubular fibrosis []."}
