72991,"A 51-year-old (172 cm, 72.7 kg) man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presented with acute neurologic decline including a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure prompting hospital admission. The patient underwent an extensive workup encompassing 28 days of persistent functional decline and progressive paralysis. The investigation concluded with a sural nerve biopsy that revealed neurolymphomatosis (DLBCL) with secondary nerve microvasculitis.\nThe decision was made to treat with 8 grams/m2 and administer 15 grams of MTX based on a CG estimated creatinine clearance of >120 mL/min calculated using a serum creatinine of <0.4 mg/dL (comparable to available creatinine values in 1 month prior to admission) and body surface area (BSA) of 1.88 m2. Unfortunately, dysautonomia associated with the neurologic syndrome precipitated a hypotensive event requiring vasopressor support and a delay of chemotherapy. This acute decompensation prompted increased scrutiny of the patient's renal function beyond standard serum creatinine measurements. A cystatin C measurement returned at 1.81 mg/L, which indicated a CKD EPICr-CysC eGFR of 69 mL/min/1.73 m2 (70 mL/min). The MTX dose was subsequently decreased by 20% to 12 grams in accordance with the impaired renal function. MTX was administered followed by leucovorin rescue according to protocol []. Routine monitoring included daily serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations, urine output, and serum MTX concentrations 48 hours after the infusion initiation and every 24 hours thereafter. On day +2 of MTX therapy, serum creatinine remained 0.4 mg/dL, cystatin C was 1.86 mg/L (CKD EPICr-CysC eGFR of 68 mL/min/1.73 m2, 74 mL/min), and the corresponding serum MTX level was 0.44 μmol/L (desired level < 0.1 μmol/L). Daily serum MTX concentrations are shown in . During this timeframe, the patient experienced mild hypokalemia, grade 1 elevation in aspartate aminotransferase without clinically evident symptoms. MTX concentrations were measured until a level of <0.1 μmol/L was achieved at day +6 at which point supportive care measures (leucovorin, intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, and furosemide) were discontinued. Continued observation over the next 7 days demonstrated no change in the patient's neurologic status, and rituximab (375 mg/m2) in combination with 5 days of high-dose methylprednisolone (1 gram) were administered. Unfortunately, the patient still showed no improvement over the next several days. The decision was made to pursue comfort measures, and the patient expired soon after.",1.72,72.7,24.57
157400,"A 73-year-old woman (height, 153 cm; weight, 53 kg), who underwent spine surgery at the same hospital as case 1 and 2, had mild subcutaneous emphysema on postoperative day 2. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema were presented on chest X-ray. Chest CT revealed a laceration on the posterior membranous wall of the mid-trachea (). However, the patient's symptoms were mild enough to recover by close observation with conservative treatment.",1.53,53.0,22.64
114398,"In 2003, the Department of Oral Pathology and Surgery at the School of Dentistry, University of Athens referred a young 22-year-old female with Hajdu-Cheney Syndrome (HCS) to the Postgraduate Clinic of the Department of Periodontology, in order to receive periodontal treatment (Fig. ). The patient was diagnosed in 2001 with HCS after clinical, radiographic and histological examination (Fig. ). After gene examination of both parents, none of them was found bearing a mutation in the NOTCH2 gene []. Her physical examination showed that her height was 145cm and her weight was 45kg. The patient had thick coarse hair, low-set ears, small face and stature, thin lips, small mouth and short hands with clubbing of the fingertips (Fig. ). According to her medical history, the patient suffered from emphysema and allergic rhinitis, whereas oral intake of Vitamin D and calcium were prescribed daily for the treatment of osteoporosis [, ].\nDuring orthodontic treatment between the ages of 12 and 21 years, all of her first premolars were removed []. At the age of 20 years, the patient received non-surgical periodontal treatment (scaling and root surface debridement), as well as limited periodontal surgery in the lower anterior region [, ]. Detailed records regarding both orthodontic and periodontal treatment were not available. The patient was a non-smoker, visited her dentist every 6 months, brushed her teeth twice every day (Bass technique) and used dental floss and interdental brushes. At the time of the referral, the patient suffered from generalized advanced chronic periodontitis, increased tooth mobility and premature tooth loss []. Clinical and radiographic examination of both parents and her 4 years younger brother showed that the mother and the younger brother had normal dentition, whereas the father was diagnosed with chronic advanced periodontal disease with increased mobility of various teeth.\nThe patient was treated in collaboration with the Department of Prosthodontics. Clinical and radiographic examination of the patient revealed a number of significant findings. There was generalized horizontal bone loss of ~ 50%. However, alveolar bone loss around various teeth such as #4 (in place of #5), 14 and 24 was extensive (~ 100%). Tooth roots appeared short and cervical, whereas cervical resorption lesions were also evident (teeth #3, 10, 20 (in place of #19), 26) [, ]. The patient received non-surgical periodontal treatment in all four quadrants, which included scaling and root surface debridement. During this period, teeth #4, 14 and 24 were extracted due to extensive alveolar bone loss []. The maxilla was then rehabilitated with the placement of a provisional fixed partial denture of metal acrylic and the anterior region of the mandible with the placement of a Maryland bridge [] (Fig. ). Upon completion of the periodontal treatment, the patient was enrolled in a periodontal maintenance program.\nAfter careful consideration of the possible implications deriving from the patient’s condition (osteoporosis, generalized advanced periodontitis) and having taken her young age into account, we decided to proceed with the placement of dental implants, while implementing specific protocols such as longer healing periods. So, although in the current literature no other case of implant placement in a patient with HCS was described, in February 2005, a dental implant (Nobel Biocare, Replace Select Straight, TiUnite RP 4.3 x 13mm) was placed in the upper right first premolar region [] (Figs. , ).\nDuring the healing period, in March 2009, further teeth were extracted (#2,3,30). During the extraction of tooth #30, a bovine xenograft (Geistlich Bio-Oss Collagen 250 mg) was placed in the post-extraction site, in order to achieve ridge preservation [] and the region was rehabilitated with a resin-bonded bridge (Maryland bridge).\nFive years after placement and successful osseointegration of the dental implant in position #5, an additional implant (Nobel Biocare, Replace Select Tapered TiUnite Regular Platform (RP) 4.3 x 8mm) was placed in the upper right first molar region (Fig. ). Bone mineral density appeared physiological (Bone Type III) (Fig. ).\nSix months after implant placement, a porcelain fused to metal, three unit implant supported fixed partial denture 3 (4) 5 was placed in the upper right region (Fig. ). During this period of time, teeth # 18, 19 were extracted due to excessive bone loss.\nClinical and radiographic examination of the patient during the periodontal maintenance program in three months interval after implant placement revealed no abnormalities in the implant region. After successful oral rehabilitation of the posterior upper right region, 2 additional dental implants were placed in the posterior left region (during surgery tooth #20 - in place of #21- was extracted) and 1 in the posterior right region of the mandible (Straumann Standard Platform (SP) Tissue Level) (Figs. -).\nSix months after implant placement, a porcelain fused to metal, three unit implant supported fixed partial denture [] 19 18 was placed in the left region of the mandible, whereas a porcelain fused to metal implant supported crown was placed in the right region of the mandible (Fig. ).\nFive years after implant placement, clinical and radiographic examination of the patient during the periodontal maintenance program (in three months interval) revealed no abnormalities (Figs. -).\nFor the reader’s better understanding, Table presents the patient’s detailed dental treatment chronologically.",1.45,45.0,21.4
77775,"A 75-year-old, 71 kg, 152 cm woman underwent left knee arthroplasty. General anesthesia was induced with 130 mg propofol, 0.2 μg/kg/min remifentanil, and 40 mg rocuronium. Following tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Ten minutes after induction of general anesthesia, her BP and HR decreased to 70/50 mmHg and 50 bpm, respectively. Incremental doses of ephedrine (8 mg × 2), 0.2 mg phenylephrine and 0.5 mg atropine were administered intravenously. Both BP and HR responded well to these treatments and increased to 150/70 mm Hg and 75 bpm, respectively. Twenty minutes before the end of surgery, 50 mg flurbiprofen axetil was administered. The total operation time was 99 minutes. Before extubation, sugammadex 2.8 mg/kg was administered. Three minutes after the injection of sugammadex, her systolic BP fell to 40/undetectable mm Hg, together with thoracic erythema, with no response to 0.2 mg phenylephrine injection. No respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing and high airway resistance, were observed. Suspecting a possible allergic reaction to sugammadex, we intravenously administered 0.5 mg adrenaline, 5 mg chlorpheniramine maleate, 50 mg ranitidine hydrochloride, and 300 mg hydrocortisone. Her BP gradually increased to 160/80 mmHg after these treatments. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) without extubation. Her trachea was extubated 15 hours later in the ICU when she was fully awake and hemodynamically stable. She was transferred out of the ICU the following morning. Four weeks after the operation, an intradermal allergy test with dilutions of propofol, rocuronium, flurbiprofen axetil, and sugammadex was performed. A 1:1000 dilution of all the drugs showed a negative reaction. However, a 1:100 dilution of sugammadex resulted in a positive reaction (Table ).",1.52,71.0,30.73
74639,"A 78-year-old Sri Lankan man presented to the emergency department with acute onset upper and lower limb weakness for several-hour duration. The patient denied any limb weakness on the night prior to admission and was otherwise healthy. Upon waking up in the morning he found difficulty in getting up with weakness involving all four limbs. He was able to lift limbs but was unable to walk or dress himself. The weakness persisted and remained the same until the time of admission five hours later. Weakness was symmetrical and nonprogressive and involved all four limbs. There was no pain, numbness, or abnormal movements in limbs. Swallowing and breathing were not impaired. Urinary and faecal incontinence were absent.\nPatient's past medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and systolic heart failure. Home medications included Mixtard 18 U mane and 8 U vesper, Losartan 50 mg twice daily, Nifedipine 20 mg twice daily, Spironolactone 50 mg daily, Frusemide 40 mg daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and Amiodarone 100 mg daily. Dietary history revealed that he was drinking king coconut water 2–4 servings almost every day for past one week.\nHe was overweight (height: 166 cm, weight: 70 kg, BMI: 25.4 kg/m2). Xanthelasma and arcus senilis were present. He had elevated blood pressure (140/90) with cardiac apex lying in 6th intercostal space. Examination of limbs revealed symmetrical weakness with more distal involvement (proximal 4/5, distal 3/5). Limb reflexes were not impaired except for absent bilateral ankle jerks. Impaired sensation of pain and temperature was present in a glove and stocking type distribution. Joint position sensation was diminished in both upper and lower limbs. Examination of central nervous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems was normal.\nInvestigations revealed renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 3.66 mg/dl-, eGFR: 15 ml/min, blood urea: 20.32 mmol/l, and arterial blood HCO3−: 12.7 meq/l). He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium: 7.02 mmol/l) with electrocardiogram showing tall, tented T waves and sine waves. Serum sodium was 129 meq/l. Renal ultrasound showed increased cortical echogenicity and impaired corticomedullary demarcation. Noncontrast computerized tomography of brain revealed normal findings. Electromyogram did not reveal acute radiculopathy, plexopathy, or myopathy. Nerve conduction studies revealed distal segmental axonal neuropathy suggestive of diabetic polyneuropathy.\nStandard ward protocol for managing hyperkalemia was followed. Patient was initially given IV 10% calcium gluconate 10 ml over 10 minutes followed by a repeat dose. Spironolactone and Losartan were immediately withheld. He was given IV 50% Dextrose 50 ml with 10 U of Soluble Insulin. Patient was nebulized with Salbutamol 5 ml over 10 minutes and it was repeated twice. The interventions showed biochemical and electrocardiographic improvement in two hours (serum potassium: 6.1 meq/l). He was commenced on calcium resonium 15 g three times daily. Limb weakness showed rapid clinical improvement within 24 hours.",1.66,70.0,25.4
131655,"A 14-year-old girl was admitted to the outpatient orthopedic clinic with complaints of increasing pain and fatigue on her left knee for one month. On physical examination, the patient’s weight (40 kg (<3p) and height 146 cm (<3p) were measured. Her left knee movements were minimally limited. Bilateral knee X-ray and lower extremity long bone radiograms were obtained, and the patient was referred to us. Radiograms revealed radiolucent bone lesions proximal to the left tibia and distal to the right femur and extensive decrease in bone densities (). Other bones were scanned to detect the presence of bone lesion. A bone lesion with similar appearance was observed in distal part of the fifth metacarp of the left hand. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) of both lower extremities was performed to aid in differential diagnosis. Likewise, CT demonstrated expansile, hypodense bone lesions at a location proximal to the left tibia and distal to the right femur (, remarkable laboratory findings were as follows: calcium, 13.4 mg/dL (8.6–10 mg/dL); phosphorus, 2.22 mg/dL (2.6–4 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase 636 IU/L (73–189 IU/L); 25-OH Vitamin D3 1.25 µg/L (10–55 µg/L), and PTH 1441 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL).\nWith available findings, lesions were thought to be Brown tumors due to PHPT. Neck ultrasonography (USG) and parathyroid scintigraphy (Tc99m sestamibi) were performed to investigate the etiology. In the neck US, a lesion compatible with parathyroid adenoma was observed near the lower left thyroid gland (). Sintigraphy also showed findings consistent with parathyroid adenoma. The patient was diagnosed with parathyroid adenoma and Brown tumor developed secondary to parathyroid adenoma.\nParathyroid adenoma was removed by the department of surgery. The calcium and PTH levels were normal after parathyroidectomy. The patient had no complaints at 1-month follow-up; and the calcium, PTH, and phosphorus levels were normal. The size of the lesions seen in the knee radiogram also decreased (). Thus, without the need for biopsy, it was proved that the lesions were Brown tumor, and they developed due to parathyroid adenoma.",1.46,40.0,18.77
22383,"We report the case of a 30-year-old nulliparous black woman with a history of primary mesenteric cystic lymphangioma requiring multiple bowel resections in childhood. This history was responsible for chronic malabsorption resulting from short bowel syndrome, for which our patient received long-term monthly supplemental parenteral nutrition. She weighed 41 kg for 1.57 m at the beginning of pregnancy (a body mass index [BMI] of 16.6).\nHer first trimester of pregnancy followed a normal course and combined aneuploidy screening did not identify increased risk (combined risk 1/10,000). A control ultrasound at 22 WG showed a eutrophic female fetus with no observable morphological abnormalities (particularly of the urinary tract and abdomen) or excess amniotic fluid.\nAt 26 WG, our patient presented with mild to moderate bowel occlusion on computed tomography (CT) scan. Medical treatment involving nasogastric intubation and parenteral nutrition supplementation provided rapid though transient clinical improvement. After multidisciplinary consultation, it was decided to maintain exclusive parenteral nutrition until the end of the pregnancy due to signs of recurrent occlusion at 28 WG.\nAt 29 WG, our patient was hospitalized for bilateral lumbar pain. A renal ultrasound revealed dilatation of the bilateral pyelocaliceal cavities (27 mm on the right, 30 mm on the left) attributed to compression by the gravid uterus. Given the persistent pain and a slight rise in serum creatinine (63 to 84 micromol/L), an internal ureteral bypass with double J stents was rapidly performed. The procedure proved to be difficult due to ureteral siphons hindering the insertion of the stents and resulted in accidental bilateral ureteral perforation. Postoperative pain required the use of level III analgesics: oral morphine: immediate release oxycodone 5 mg 4 times a day and nefopam 120 mg continuous intravenous daily.\nAt 29 weeks and 4 days gestation, our patient was transferred to an ICU near the level 3 maternity ward. A CT scan revealed significant uroperitoneum and bilateral pleural effusion. Worsening of respiratory manifestations and onset of acute renal impairment (serum creatinine 180 micromol/L, potassium 5.2 mmol/L) required thoracic drainage (1900 mL) and bilateral nephrostomies. Our patient’s nephrological and respiratory condition rapidly improved.\nDuring her ICU stay, our patient presented painful uterine contractions, for which she received tocolytic treatment with atosiban. For the persistent low back pain, morphine was continued intravenously at a mean dose of 50 mg of oxynorm per day (patient-controlled analgesia). Antenatal corticosteroid therapy was given. The fetal heart rate (FHR) was normal.\nOn ultrasound, the fetus was eutrophic (estimated fetal weight [EFW]: 1250 g at 29 weeks and 3 days), in cephalic presentation, with a moderate excess of amniotic fluid (cisterna magna 112 mm) and increased bladder volume. At 29 weeks and 5 days gestation, 5 days after parenteral introduction of high-dose opioids, fetal megacystis increased (50 mm × 52 mm) and was associated with pyelocaliceal dilatation (Fig. ).\nThree days later, an ultrasound revealed voluminous fetal ascites and a small bladder with thickened walls (3 mm) (Fig. ). The fetal kidneys were morphologically normal. No anasarca or sign of fetal anemia (normal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity) was evident and the amniotic fluid index was normal. Possible spontaneous bladder rupture with urinary peritonitis was suggested. In the absence of a clear cause, the morphine derivatives administered to the mother, for 8 days (from 29 to 30 + 1 WG), were suggested as a contributing factor to the fetal megacystis.\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion (pediatric surgeon, pediatric nephrologist, and obstetrician), anticipatory management was decided. Urgent extraction or draining of antenatal ascites were not performed because fetal hemodynamics were satisfactory. Our patient was closely monitored with three fetal heart rate (FHR) recordings per day and two ultrasounds per week. The maternal and fetal condition remained stable for 9 days (from 30 weeks and 1 day to 31 weeks and 3 days) and the fetal bladder remained unchanged throughout the monitoring.\nAt 31 weeks and 4 days gestation, our patient went into labor spontaneously and received epidural anesthesia. Labor was rapid and marked by moderate FHR abnormalities. Our patient gave birth vaginally to a girl weighing 1700 g, presenting moderate ischemic anoxia with Apgar scores at 1/1/10 and umbilical cord pH 7.19 (artery) and 7.27 (vein). Neonatal intensive care included mask ventilation followed by orotracheal intubation and external cardiac massage. Paracentesis of ascites (300 mL citrinic fluid) was carried out at 8 minutes. The infant was then transferred to the ICU. Her respiratory state required tracheal instillation of surfactant with a favorable respiratory outcome. Her hemodynamic condition was stable. No definite neonatal infection was identified, and intravenous antibiotic treatment was maintained for 8 days with cefotaxim based on the notion of peripheral ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli carriage. Enteral feeding was initiated on the first day with the mother’s milk and then with specific infant formula for preterm neonates, followed by central line parenteral nutrition for 15 days. Transfontanellar cranial ultrasounds showed a grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage with no parenchymal lesion.\nAscites drained at birth showed a biochemical profile similar to plasma, in favor of uroperitoneum. No metabolic disorder was found except for a plasma creatinine level at 79 μl/L on day 1 which quickly normalized within the first week of life. A urinary catheter was inserted following delivery. The abdominal ultrasounds performed on day 1 and day 6 were normal with a normal bladder wall. Cystography was normal on day 9 and the bladder catheter was removed. Ascites did not recur. The infant’s course was favorable without complications during hospitalization.\nRegular pediatric monitoring was performed after discharge and showed a strictly normal outcome at last follow-up at 2 years of age (adjusted). The mother has been regularly monitored and has presented no complication. From a medical standpoint, a new pregnancy is not recommended.",1.57,41.0,16.63
53908,"A 15-year-old male patient presented to the clinic reporting exertion palpitations and feeling hot, with no other complaints. The patient had no growth chart until he came to our hospital. The patient did not gain weight as well as his monozygotic twin brother ().\nA physical examination revealed the following: pulse, 120 beats per minute; blood pressure, 140/80 mmHg; weight, 50 kg; height, 173 cm; body mass index (BMI) 16.7 kg/m2; and BMI percentile according to age, 6.1. No abnormalities in the heart, lung, abdomen, or nerve were detected. However, he presented signs of hand tremor at rest, and an enlarged thyroid gland was detected with a firm density. No eye abnormalities due to hyperthyroidism and no signs of acromegaly, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea were detected. He had normal secondary sexual characteristics, with his genitalia and pubic hair (Tanner stage 3). The patient had no history of prior thyroid disease. The monozygotic twin brother presented no clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, with a normal thyroid function test.\nThe test results revealed secondary hyperthyroidism, with elevated FT3 levels at 23.08 pmol/L, FT4 levels of 86.32 pmol/L, and TSH levels of 8.25 mUI/L. Investigations of other hormones, including cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and prolactin, showed normal results ().\nThyroid ultrasound revealed that the thyroid gland was heterogeneous, without increased vascularity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary showed a pituitary lesion with mild hyperintensity on the T2-weighted image (), which was less enhancing than the surrounding pituitary parenchyma () and measured 5 × 6 × 7 mm in size. This lesion was suspected to be a pituitary microadenoma.\nThe patient could not afford the cost of somatostatin analog; therefore, thyroid hormone levels were normalized by methimazole (20 mg per day) and propranolol (10 mg three times per day) before performing an endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor. When the patient was admitted to the hospital for surgery, he received a short-term treatment with sandostatin (0.1 mg three times a day), propylthiouracil (PTU), and propranolol. Because the patient was treated with oral methimazole 20 mg per day for 5 months and still had high serum FT4 before surgery, we switched to PTU to prevent thyroid storm during surgery. Postoperative pathology results revealed an adenoma of the pituitary gland ().\nAfter surgery, the doses of PTU and propranolol were gradually reduced. Two weeks following the operation, the patient was stabilized, PTU and propranolol were discontinued, and he was discharged from the hospital. Serum TSH and FT4 levels were evaluated and showed a decreasing tendency after treatment ().\nAfter discharge, the patient presented no clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. His weight was 50 kg before surgery and, 2 years later, it was 60 kg (gain 10 kg in 2 years); his height was 173 cm before surgery and later, his height was 175 cm. Hormonal testing after discharge was performed after 2 months, 6 months, and 18 months, and serum TSH, FT4, ACTH, and cortisol levels were detected in the normal range. MRI of the pituitary gland after 1 () and 2 years () showed the complete removal of the tumor, with no recurrence.",1.73,60.0,20.05
24324,"A 31-year-old black Congolese female patient, P3G3, who had a pregnancy of 38 weeks and four days, was transferred from a district hospital to a tertiary facility in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, for severe preeclampsia with acute on chronic fetal distress. Her past medical history was notable for eclampsia during her first pregnancy in 2011 and preeclampsia in 2013 during her second pregnancy. She had had two cesarean sections for her pregnancies, and she had her antenatal care for her third pregnancy at a referral hospital. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her third pregnancy for which she received 250 mg alpha-methyl-dopa twice a day. ​​During the 30th week of gestation, the patient’s systolic blood pressure became labile, oscillating between 140 and 150 mmHg, despite her antihypertension medication. The patient consulted at a district hospital where she underwent a fetal wellbeing ultrasound which did not find anomalies.\nThe patient was the 7th of 9 children, and her father was hypertensive. She weighed 72 kg for 155 cm, and upon arrival at the authors’ hospital, her blood pressure was 217/152 mmHg. Her heart rate was 101 bpm, her respiratory rate was 24 cpm, and SpO2 was 96% free air. The patient was in pain, she was lucid and coherent, her palpebral conjunctivae were colored, and she had bilateral pitting edema. The fundus height was at 30 cm, the presentation was cephalic, the fetus was bradycardic at 88 bpm, and there were no signs of genital bleeding. The cervix was median, soft, 80% effaced with a 2 cm dilation. Urine deep stick revealed 3+ proteinuria. She had 1.5 mg/dL of creatinine (normal: 0.5–1.5 mg/dL), 22 mg/dL of urea (normal: 10–50 mg/dL), 15,000 white blood cells/ml, 213,000 platelets/ml and 14 g/dL hemoglobin. Based on these findings, we indicated an emergency cesarean section for acute fetal distress, which resulted in the extraction of a dead infant.\nPostoperative suites were marked on day two by decompensated anemia (hemoglobin at 7.8 mg/dL) for which the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. On postoperative day three, the patient presented an abdominal effusion, exacerbation of the bilateral pitting edema, blood pressure increase, hematemesis, melena, petechiae, hematuria, and oliguria. Her blood pressure was 215/120 mmHg and she had signs of renal failure (creatinine = 6.9 mg/dL (normal: 0.84–1.21 mg/dL); urea 132.5 mg/dL (normal: 5–20 mg/dL); hyperkalemia at 6.4 mmol/L (normal: 3.5–5 mmol/L); hyponatremia 109 mmol/L (normal: 136–145 mmol/L); hypocalcemia 0.88 mmol/L (normal: 1.12–1.32 mmol/L)), and signs of hepatic failure (AST 135 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; ALT 325 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; prothrombin ratio 100% (normal: 80–110%). PTT was 39 s (normal: 24–35 s), LDH was 1398 IU/L (normal: 120–280 IU/L), and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (normal: 0-1 mg/dL)). She equally had neutrophilic leukocytosis at 22,180 cells/mm3 and low platelets at 44,000 cells/mm3. Additionally, schistocytes were identified in the peripheral thin smear.\nThe team excluded TTP and HELLP syndrome as possible causes of the postpartum microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). This decision was based on the history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was retained as the final diagnosis, and in the absence of anti-complement therapy, the patient underwent four sessions of hemodialysis. Hypertension was treated with Nicardipine, 5 mg/hr. IV with a 2.5 mg/hr. increase every 15 min without exceeding 15 mg/hr., and the goal was to lower the systolic blood pressure below 160 mmHg. Hyperkalemia was corrected with insulin and glucose (10 units of insulin dose with 25 g of glucose per each 1 mmol/L of potassium above the normal). A favorable clinical and biologic evolution was observed, and the patient was released for outpatient follow-up on postoperative day 18 (Figs. , and ).\nLaboratory tests could not be obtained more frequently due to their financial burden to the patient and her immediate family. The patient had a normal kidney function at postoperative day 160 (urea 24.2 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL) and postoperative day 202 (urea 16.9 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL). She did not present new episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.",1.55,72.0,29.97
120487,"A 36-year-old, wheelchair-bound, 28-week primigravida presented with pregnancy complicated by recurrent chest infections and progressive worsening of dyspnea requiring supplemental oxygen and multiple hospital admissions. Her recurrent chest infections were attributed to her idiopathic kyphoscoliosis which continued to deteriorate slowly despite corrective surgery (Harrington's rods) performed at the age of 15 years. Unfortunately, her old notes were not available to fully evaluate her precorrection severity of scoliosis and response to surgical correction. She denied knowledge of any previous anesthetic or surgical complications. Following her detailed medical and obstetric evaluation, for maternal safety, it was decided to proceed with the delivery of baby by CS, and she was referred for preanesthetic assessment accordingly.\nOn assessment, she weighed 53 kg and was estimated to be 1.5 m tall. She was dyspneic but maintaining SpO2 of 95% on oxygen 2 L/min through nasal cannulae. On examination, she had marked thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis and lumbar lordosis, and old surgery scar was visible extending from upper thoracic to lower lumbar region. She was unable to flex thoracic or lumbar spine due to the presence of Harrington's rods. Chest X-ray [] revealed S-shaped deformity of trachea indicative of difficult airway. Lower end of Harrington's rod and lumbar vertebrae could not be visualized as those were obscured by the abdominal shield used to protect the fetus from radiation.\nChest X-ray demonstrated tracheal and spinal deformity as well as Harrington's rods but obscured the lower end of the rods due to the pelvic shield [].\nBedside ultrasonography of the spine was performed which revealed acceptable acoustic windows and returned good dural signals at L2–L3, L3–L4, and L4–L5 vertebral interspaces; the lower pole of the Harrington's rods was seen at L1–L2 vertebral interspace [].\nParasagittal ultrasound in longitudinal section demonstrating the lower end of Harrington's rod and acoustic signals from the dura [].\nConsidering her clinical condition and fetal prematurity, CS under RA was considered safer than GA for both mother and the baby. After careful consideration of risks and benefits and discussion with the patient, ultrasound-assisted placement of continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) was planned to mitigate the challenges posed by in situ metal work, scarring from previous surgery, the presence of exaggerated curvature in her spine, and anticipated difficulty in positioning the patient for spinal catheter placement.\nAfter obtaining informed consent and institution of monitoring including pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, and arterial line (for invasive blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood gas sampling), and ultrasound (curved array probe 2–5 mHz, Sonosite®, MicroMaxx, Bothwell, WA, USA) assisted prepuncture marking of skin were done and distance to dorsal dura from skin was measured. In right decubitus position and under strict aseptic conditions, a 20-gauge epidural catheter was placed into L3–L4 intrathecal space through an 18-gauge Tuohy needle uneventfully in the first attempt. After positioning the patient supine on three pillows to facilitate breathing and to limit the cephalad spread of the injectate, a mixture of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 20 mg total and fentanyl 15 μg was administered intrathecally through the spinal catheter in four equal aliquots, each 5 min apart. She was monitored for hypotension, bradycardia, or breathing deterioration after each aliquot. After 25 min, a T6 level block to light touch was achieved without any complications, and the surgeons proceeded with CS accordingly. CS was completed uneventfully; intrathecal catheter was removed, and the patient was monitored in intensive care unit for 24 h. Multimodal postoperative analgesia was provided. She had an unremarkable recovery and was discharged home on day 7.",1.5,53.0,23.56
26525,"A 15-year-old male presented to the Pediatric Cardiology Department in January 2019 with dyspnea at rest accompanied by chest pain. Medical interview revealed that the patient was suffering from mild abdominal pain, headache and asthenia in last few days. Medical and family history was unremarkable, he was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and scoliosis. He has never been chronically treated. Physical examination revealed a young Caucasian who was in an obvious acute distress. Vital signs at presentation were blood pressure 110/82 mmHg, heart rate 100/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.6 °C, oxygen saturation 99% without oxygen support, height 179 cm, weight 52 kg. Pertinent objective findings were muffled heart sounds, distention of the jugular veins, ascites with hepatomegaly and right lower quadrant tenderness on palpation with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Laboratory results showed white blood cells (WBC) 4,870/uL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 44.7%, platelets 152.000/uL, glucose 124 mg/dl, international normalized ratio 1.3; C-reactive protein <5 mg/l, Troponin T 8.8 ng/l. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, small amplitude of QRS complex, ST elevation and depression of PQ segment in many canals. Echocardiography was performed, 40 mm pericardial fluid was depicted. Patient was diagnosed with heart tamponade. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, what is more, drainage tubes were inserted into the pericardial cavity. The samples of blood and purulent fluid were collected for microbiological tests. No germs developed in the bacterial examination of the pericardial fluid. Broad-spectered antibiotics were applied with colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Contrast-enhanced computed tomogram revealed pericardiac and bilateral pleural effusions, moreover an appendix with appendicolith (). After evaluation by a general surgeon, the appendectomy was postponed until the etiology of pericarditis would be clarified. Although, the patient was consulted by many specialists, none of them was able to disclose the ground of the patient’s disease. Many laboratory tests were conducted. Not only contagious diseases were excluded, but also lymphoma, cystic fibrosis, connective tissue disorders, immune deficiency, hypothyroidism, coeliac disease. The patient’s plasma level of antibodies was negative for numerous pathogens (aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Ebstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, hepatic viruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, yersinia enterocolica, Candida etc). Moreover, heart magnetic resonance imaging was performed and, based on the results, the patient was diagnosed with restrictive pericarditis (). After one month of hospitalization the inflammatory parameters increased (WBC 22.210/ul, C-reactive protein 14.1 mg/l, procalcitonin 0.18 ng/mL) additionally the hemodynamic parameters worsened. The patient subsequently underwent partial pericardectomy through anterolateral left thoracotomy performed by the an experienced professor of pediatric cardiac surgery. The clinical postoperative evolution was favorable, with normal echocardiographic aspect. The drainage tubes were extirpated. From the patient’s point of view that period of hospitalization was the most stressful. He demanded some psychologists’ help in aim to return to normal activity. 5 days after the patient had been discharged, he was readmitted to the Emergency Department, because of acute abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness on palpation without vomiting, nausea or fever. The abdominal ultrasonography revealed prominent appendix with an appendicolith up to 25 mm consistent with probable acute appendicitis. In addition, echocardiography was performed and reported recurrence of pericardial effusion. After evaluation by a surgeon, the patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. The clinical postoperative evolution was favorable moreover the effusive fluid absorbed completely. The patient was discharged 4 days after the operation with signs of normal wound healing and continues to do well 1 year postsurgery. He does his regular check-ups in a medical clinic.",1.79,52.0,16.23
83184,"A 60-year-old man (height, 163 cm; weight, 80 kg; BMI, 30.1) with right knee osteoarthritis grade 3 of Kellgren-Lawrence classification [] underwent a right TKR using a High-Flex, posterior-stabilized (PS), and fixed-bearing Exactech Optetrak High-Flex prosthesis (Miami, Florida, USA). Metal components were cobalt-chromium based alloys. A conventional medial para-patellar approach was performed and all components were fixed with cement. The patella was not resurfaced. Adequate ligamentous balancing as well as flexion and extension gaps were assessed intraoperatively and confirmed by postoperative standing radiographic control. As routinely, medial and lateral facets of the tibial baseplate were tested during surgery to corroborate complete locking of the posterior dovetails.\nThe rehabilitation protocol consisted of full-weight bearing and walker-assisted ambulation for a month and afterwards without any assistive device. The postoperative course was uneventful. There were neither popping sounds nor clicking sensations. An acceptable range of motion of 0°–130° was assessed at six months postoperatively, achieving 90 points of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score.\nAt 32 weeks postoperatively, the patient complained of a sudden onset of knee pain associated with restricted range of motion. During physical examination, an audible popping sound was emanated from a swollen right knee. No signs of patellar instability were found. Although no specific injury was reported, the patient referred that a week earlier he had suffered a half-meter fall from a bus with both knees held in semiflexion. Radiographs evidenced a subtle sign of a polyethylene tibial insert dislocation, apparently displaced anteromedially (). A CT-scan discarded component malrotation and loosening.\nSurgery was undertaken to change the polyethylene insert. Although radiographic images had suggested a potential insert dislocation, an initial arthroscopy was performed to confirm the diagnosis and to discard other additional causes of painful TKR with restricted motion: patellar dislocation; patellar clunk syndrome; arthrofibrosis; loose bodies; and so forth. Open surgery was then executed following the same anterior approach, as shown in Supplementary Video 1 (in Supplementary Material available online at ). The insert was found to be totally dislodged from the tibial baseplate and displaced anteriorly, as shown in and in Video 1. Macroscopic examination of the retrieved liner revealed compression deformation damage at the posteromedial aspect of the inferior surface of the polyethylene, keeping the superior face intact () (Video 1). Intraoperative C-reactive protein levels [] and culture samples taken during surgery resulted negative for infection.\nFemoral and tibial metal components were well fixed to bone and exhibited neither damage nor rotational deviation during intraoperative evaluation. Hence, a new 9-mm High-Flex PS liner was placed, immediately regaining a range of 0°–130°.\nOne month following the bearing exchange, the patient developed a postoperative infection secondary to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which ultimately required a two-stage revision surgery.",1.63,80.0,30.11
71716,"A 34-year-old woman (height = 160 cm; weight = 50 kg) was scheduled for emergency surgery due to an open fracture of her left tibia and closed fracture of her right femur, which were sustained during a traffic accident. She had no past medical history. There were no other organ injuries, including those of the neck, face, thorax, or abdomen. The results from an ECG and chest radiograph revealed no acute or pathologic lesions.\nAfter obtaining informed consent for surgery and anesthesia, the patient entered the operating room and routine monitoring, including capnography, a 3-lead ECG, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, mechanosensor-neuromuscular transmission (M-NMT) module, and Entropy module on Datex-Ohmeda, was performed. Her initial blood pressure (BP) was 120/70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats/min, and her pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99%. After preoxygenation with 100% O2 at 8 L/min delivered through a mask for a few minutes, a remifentanil infusion (0.02 mcg/kg/min) was started and 80 mg of propofol was administered intravenously. After LOC, supramaximal stimulation using NMT was checked; thereafter, 35 mg of rocuronium was injected. Tracheal intubation using a cuffed 7.0-mm endotracheal tube was performed without difficulty. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5 L/min of O2, 1.5 L/min of medical air, 1.0 to 2.0 vol% of sevoflurane, and a 0.02 - 0.10 mcg/kg/min remifentanil infusion. Thirty minutes after intubation, surgical drapes and other preparations were completed and an incision was performed. Her vital signs and other monitored parameters were within a 20% range of the preoperative levels.\nHowever, 45 min after intubation, the response entropy (RE) abruptly increased up to 100 and the state entropy (SE) to 91. NMT was exhibited in 4 of the counts with a 46% train of four (TOF) ratio, even though capnography showed no sign of spontaneous breathing. There were no significant changes in her vital signs. Even though 3 vol% of sevoflurane was temporarily administered, the entropy did not change. Because there was no other evidence of ROC, we applied additional EEG monitoring and used the Root with SedLine monitor (Fig. ) and confirmed a PSI of 50% and EMG of 23% (Fig. ). We assumed that the elevated EMG activity might cause an unusual elevation in the readings from the Entropy monitor. Thereafter, 10 mg of rocuronium was injected. After a few tens of seconds, TOF of NMT and RE/SE values on the Entropy monitor decreased gradually and simultaneously. When the NMT count reached 2 (2 mins after rocuronium injection), 59% of RE, 58% of SE, 40% of PSI, and 0% of EMG were assessed. Coincidently, the surgeon started to hammer on the nail in the patient’s tibia. He hammered regularly using the continuously repeated “hit - hit - pause” method. The “pause” step occurred at approximately 1.8 Hz of frequency. Within a minute, 3 TOF counts of NMT, 94% of RE, 79% of SE, 47% of PSI, and 0% of EMG were assessed (Fig. ). However, after a few minutes, the value of entropy decreased by less than 60. Twenty minutes later, the TOF count reached 4 and RE/SE values on the Entropy monitor increased to above 90 again while the PSI values were maintained below 50. Therefore, we discontinued monitoring with Entropy.\nNo other specific events occurred during the remaining intraoperative period. The patient did not complain of recall in the postoperative period. Upon discharge from the PACU, the last memories the patient had prior to sleep were the events of the surgical time-out just after entering the operating room. The first memory the patient had after awakening was the instruction from the medical staff to open her eyes in the recovery room. The patient did not dream during surgery. Mild surgical pain and dry mouth were the only discomforts the patient complained of in the recovery room.",1.6,50.0,19.53
138672,"A 35-year-old, 70 kg, 180 cm, male patient with traumatic cervical spine injury was admitted to our intensive care unit with chief complaints of labored breathing and partial loss of power in all four limbs. After securing the airway with a tracheal tube, central venous cannulation was attempted using 7 F20 cm triple lumen catheter (Certofix, Braun, Germany). Under strict aseptic precautions landmarks were identified and right SCV was located infraclavicular at medial 2/3 and lateral 1/3 of the clavicle using introducer needle in single attempt. After confirming good backflow of the blood, guide wire (50 cm with j-tip), was introduced up to 15 cm mark without any resistance. After that tissue dilator was threaded over the guide wire followed by railroad of triple lumen catheter (up to 13 cm) over it, although the line was inserted in single pass but resistance was encountered during removal of guide wire. Gentle traction was applied several times to remove it but all in vain. Bed side chest roentgenogram revealed the guidewire going through right SCV towards SVC but after its entry it took sharp turn and entered IJV on the same side []. With bed side X-ray as a control we tried to remove the guide wire, pushing it caused the assembly to move inside the right atrium (arrhythmia elicitation) but attempts at removal resulted in decoiling at the site of insertion. This prevented the applied force from being transmitted to the stuck component. Further attempts at removal of the guidewire were deferred and patient was shifted to intervention radiology suite. The attempts at removal of guidewire by passing a tissue dilator to straighten the kinked portion were not met with success, so through percutaneous right transfemoral venous route a vascular snare was used to pull the guide wire out of IJV []. It was followed by successful railroad of long and large bore tissue dilator from the unraveled to the intact segment of guide wire from the insertion site. The incision at site of insertion was then deepened to remove the kinked portion []. Another guidewire was passed through the same dilator followed by insertion of triple lumen catheter. A post-procedural chest radiograph revealed no evidence of hemothorax or pneumothorax.",1.8,70.0,21.6
61861,"A 48-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our hospital to exclude an unrecognized infection as the cause of three episodes of fever associated with splenomegaly. Her past medical history was unremarkable up to 4 years previously, when by routine mammography and subsequent biopsy an intraductal carcinoma was diagnosed. She underwent a skin-sparing mastectomy of her right breast combined with reconstruction and implantation of a silicone prosthesis (Polytech 445 g). No adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was provided or indicated. Three years later she underwent a reduction operation of her left breast combined with lipofilling of both breasts. She had experienced fever 8 and 5 months prior to hospitalization that lasted for about 3 weeks. She was treated at home with levofloxacin because of a known allergy to penicillin.\nWhen fever appeared again together with sore throat, fatigue, sweating, cough (she smokes about 10 cigarettes daily), and an involuntary weight loss of 10 kg in the last year, she was hospitalized for 2 weeks in a peripheral hospital. Abnormal results from laboratory investigations included: hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL, leukocytes 3.6 × 109/L, serum total protein 5.3 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 638 U/L, and ferritin 398 ng/mL. An abdominal ultrasound examination demonstrated her spleen was enlarged, with a diameter of 15 cm. X-ray examination of her chest showed bilateral apical pleural scarring, which was confirmed by computed tomography (CT). CT also revealed subpleural densities of uncertain significance, an enlarged liver and spleen, ovarian cysts, and a 2.3 cm large layer of fluid in the Douglas space. There was no evidence of enlarged mediastinal, abdominal, or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A histologic examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen was of no diagnostic help. 18FDG-PET/CT evidenced hypermetabolism of both adrenal glands. She was given azithromycin and her fever subsided but profound weakness remained. Extensive laboratory examinations did not indicate any infectious, autoimmune, or malignant diseases. She was referred to our Division of Infectious Diseases for a search for an unrecognized infectious disease.\nOn physical examination our patient was pale and weak. Her body temperature was 37.3 °C, blood pressure 110/90 mmHg, heart frequency 92 beats/minute, arterial blood oxygen saturation 98 %, body weight 59 kg, and high 168 cm. She complained of memory deficits and an unexplainable unstable gait. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. Since her breast operation 4 years previously she had needed sleeping tablets. During her first 6 days in hospital without any treatment her body temperature rose progressively from 37.3 to 39 °C. Because of the pleural scars and subpleural densities seen in the CT images, and the hypermetabolic adrenal glands shown by 18FDG-PET/CT [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations were within the normal range], a tuberculosis (TB) infection was considered. Results from a repeated search by microscopy, culture and PCR analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in her sputum and bronchial aspirate were unremarkable. A Mantoux skin test and QuantiFERON-TB assay were negative too. Leishmania infection was excluded by serology and microscopy of her bone marrow aspirate.\nDespite repeated negative blood, urine, and stool cultures for pathogenic bacteria, among the many laboratory examinations, titers of 1:160 anti-Salmonella O and 1:2560 anti-Salmonella H antibodies were detected by Widal Wright’s reaction (Table ). Thus empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 2 g daily was started. There was no response to treatment and her high fever persisted. Therefore, indomethacin 50 mg three times daily was administered. This was followed by prompt defervescence; however, it lasted only for 3 days (Fig. ). On the fourth day of indomethacin treatment, her fever of 39 °C recurred and was associated with increased weakness, malaise, and confusion. That night, two episodes of right hemiparesis with aphasia of about 30 min duration were observed. No areas of ischemia or hemorrhage were seen by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-angiography of her brain. An analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid found 282 mg/dL of protein, but there was no increase in cell number (Table ). At this point, her symptoms were treated with dexamethasone 16 mg daily for 2 days followed by methylprednisolone 1 g daily for the next 4 days and then again dexamethasone 16 mg daily. Ceftriaxone was substituted by meropenem, and empiric anti-TB treatment and treatment with fluconazole were added. Corticosteroid therapy was followed by an impressive clinical improvement, including defervescence, regaining orientation, and regaining her ability to stand and to eat. However, on the fourth day of corticosteroid treatment, her high fever recurred together with extreme weakness, anorexia, and episodes of confusion.\nThe criteria for HLH/MAS were fulfilled (Table ), but no underlying cause was evident. Because eight cases of AOSD associated with SBIs have been reported (see below), the silicone breast prosthesis of our patient was considered to have possibly contributed to her hyperinflammatory state, and consequently was explanted on the 22nd hospital day. A more detailed medical history revealed that the breast prosthesis had caused our patient many problems. Because of painful inflammation, the first prosthesis had to be explanted after 6 weeks and necrotic inflammatory tissue surrounding the prosthesis removed. Because an infection was suspected, the prosthesis was cleaned with antiseptics and then re-implanted, but no infectious agent could be isolated. Two months later, the prosthesis had to be removed definitively. Again, necrotic inflammatory tissue had to be removed and no infectious agent could be isolated. One year prior to her current hospitalization, a new silicone breast prosthesis was implanted. An inflammatory reaction with swelling of her breast was treated locally with infiltration of corticosteroids. Thereafter, our patient could tolerate the prosthesis and a mild pain was felt only when touching the prosthesis.\nSignificant worsening occurred after removal of the intact prosthesis. Her fever rose up to 40.4 °C, she became icteric (Table ) and for the first time she experienced severe low back pain that radiated to her lower legs and required analgesic treatment with opium derivates. She complained of perianal anesthesia and fecal incontinence. The day of implant removal, 25 g of endovenous immunoglobulin was started and given daily for 3 days to treat the MAS. Finally, cyclosporine 100 mg twice daily was administered without any benefit. On the 29th hospital day, the results of the histologic examination of the tissue taken at implant removal were available and showed (a) normal pectoralis muscle with absence of neoplastic infiltration; (b) cutis and subcutis with dilated vessels showing an intraluminal proliferation of atypical large lymphocytes with a vesiculosus nucleus with several nucleoli (Fig. ). A immunohistochemical analysis of the neoplastic cells revealed positivity for cluster of differentiation (CD) 20, B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6, BCL-2, multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM-1), and weaker staining for CD5. The proliferation index Ki-67 was over 90 %. Results for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD10, CD34, CD3, and cytokeratin-CAM were negative. These results are consistent with the diagnosis of IVLBCL. The remaining parenchyma showed an extensive giant cell-lymphohistiocytic foreign body reaction, but no carcinomatous infiltration. Her familial medical history was notable for an uncle who has died from acute lymphatic leukemia at 43 years of age.\nOur patient was transferred to our Hematology Ward where she was treated with six cycles of R-CHOP [rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), vincristine, prednisone] chemotherapy. Intrathecal prophylaxis with methotrexate was also given. After 6 months her white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin level, LDH level, and liver function tests were again within the reference ranges. After 2 years our patient’s clinical status is good, but sequelae of the cauda equina syndrome are still present, including low back pain, saddle anesthesia, difficulties in voiding the bladder and intestine, loss of sexual sensation, right plantar numbness, and gait instability. She continues to undergo 3-monthly follow-up visits (see Additional file for supporting data).",1.68,59.0,20.9
116141,"A 28-year-old primiparous woman visited because of back pain. She had delivered 3 months previously and back pain had started 3 weeks before the hospital visit. Her height was 161 cm and her weight was 52 kg. She had no past surgical or family histories. Lumbar spine MRI revealed recent compression fractures of T6–T9, T12, L2, and L5. She was given calcium 500 mg daily and cholecalciferol 1,000 IU for 8 months.\nPretreatment BMD Z-score determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in all patients was -2.5±0.3 at L1–L4 and -1.5±0.7 at femur (). The post-treatment mean BMD Z-score was -1.7±0.6 at L1–L4 and -1.4±0.4 at femur. The mean BMD Z-score change was 0.8±0.6 at L1–L4, 0.1±0.4 at femur in all patients, 0.5±0.4 at L1–L4, 0.2±0.1 at femur in calcium/vitamin D supplementation group and 1.3±0.6 at L1–L4 and -0.2±0.81 in those treated with teriparatide.",1.61,52.0,20.06
142334,"A 77-year-old woman, 156 cm in height and weighing 55 kg, was diagnosed as having angina pectoris and aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, and she was scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic arch replacement. She had been a smoker for more than 50 years and had also been diagnosed as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by PA hypertension. The patient was receiving treatment with oral diltiazem hydrochloride (100 mg/day) and furosemide (20 mg/day), and mean preoperative PA pressure was 20-30 mmHg. Preoperative laboratory tests revealed no coagulation abnormalities or any other notable abnormalities. At surgery, anesthesia was induced with propofol (80 mg), fentanyl (200 µg) and muscle relaxation with rocuronium (40 mg), and tracheal intubation was performed using a normal endotracheal tube (7 mm in internal diameter; Parker Flex-Tip™, Parker Medical, USA). No marked circulatory variations or abnormalities were observed during the induction of the general anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with 40% of oxygen, propofol (target-controlled infusion: 2.0 µg/ml), and remifentanil (0.2 µg/kg/min). A central venous catheter and a PA Swan-Ganz catheter were placed via the right internal jugular vein prior to the start of the surgery. The PA Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced up to the PA while the pressure waveforms were checked under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, and it was fixed at 40 cm after 1 cm was pulled out confirming wedging of the catheter tip in the PA. PA pressure after Swan-Ganz catheter insertion was 22 mmHg (mean), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 18 mmHg.\nMaximum airway pressure suddenly increased to 26 cmH2O from 15 cmH2O 30 minutes after the beginning of surgery, when the internal carotid artery graft was being secured for the coronary artery bypass. Endotracheal hemorrhage was detected, and the tracheal tube became filled and occluded with blood. There had been no change in wedge waveform of the PA Swan-Ganz catheter before the bleeding occurred. Ventilation was disrupted for 3 minutes with a transient fall of SpO2 to 86%. However, positive pressure ventilation was maintained at airway pressures as high as 20 to 30 cmH2O with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP: 6 cmH2O) while suction of the blood filling the tracheal tube was performed, and the bleeding ceased 15 minutes after it had been detected. Bronchoscopic observation revealed numerous clots in the tracheal tube, with complete occlusion of the right main bronchus. A total of 300 ml of blood was aspirated from the airway. As continuation of the surgery was deemed impossible, the surgery was suspended and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the tracheal tube in place.\nA postoperative chest X-ray showed decreased lucency of the right lower lung field. Chest CT revealed a contrast-enhanced false aneurysm measuring 2 cm in diameter in the right PA (). Conservative treatment by mechanical ventilation with applied PEEP (6-8 cmH2O) was selected over invasive treatment because the false aneurysm was small in size and bleeding from the aneurysm had ceased. Retrospectively, chest 3D CT images were confirmed (). The right main PA was pressed by the thoracic aortic aneurysm. A chest 3D CT after surgery revealed that the PA Swan-Ganz catheter had shifted at the thoracic artery aneurysm level (). The tip of the PA Swan-Ganz catheter was maintained at a distance from PA aneurysm (). A repeat chest X-ray and CT on the 16th postoperative day revealed improvement, and the contrast-enhanced false PA aneurysm could no longer be visualized. The patient's respiratory condition also improved, and she was extubated and discharged from the ICU on the 20th postoperative day.",1.56,55.0,22.6
29764,"A 20-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a heart murmur. He had no medical history of traumatic injury or arteritis. On physical examination, his height was 168 cm, and the weight was 65 kg. His pulse rate was 64 bpm, with a blood pressure of 187/69 mmHg in both arms, and all pulses were palpable. However, systolic pressure in the brachial and ankle areas was 80 mmHg, and the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABI) was 0.5. Routine blood tests were normal. A grade 3/6 systolic murmur and a grade 3/4 diastolic murmur were audible along the third left sternum border. Examinations of the respiratory and other systems were normal. Thoracic echocardiography examination indicated grade 4 regurgitation in the aortic valve, due to the bicuspid valve. Severe left ventricular dilatation was observed, with diameters of 74.7 mm and 58.1 mm in diastolic and systolic pressures, respectively. The ejection fraction decreased to 43.6%. The serum brain natriuretic peptide level was 116 pg/mL. In chest radiography, the cardiothoracic ratio was 58%, and rib notching was observed in the inferior surface of the fifth rib. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) indicated a 4.8-mm-diameter strict CoA at the proximal part of the descending aorta (). A small-sized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was detected in the proximal portion of CoA, with a Qp/Qs ratio of 1.2. Internal mammary and intercostal arteries were dilated as collaterals for lower half of the body.\nThe diameter of the aorta was 25 mm in the proximal portion of the coarctation and 28 mm in the distal portion of the coarctation.\nTreatment for AR, CoA, and PDA was necessary. The one-stage radical operation through anterolateral thoracotomy or median sternotomy can be considered to cause high risk of complications, due to the occurrence of collateral arteries and a large range of aorta. Therefore, a two-staged surgery was performed. We planned to perform TEVAR for CoA and PDA in advance, followed by AVR through median thoracotomy.\nThe right femoral artery diameter was 8.0 mm and was suitable as the access route for TEVAR. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. The left brachial artery was exposed, and a 4-F pigtail catheter (100 cm, SZ0539) proceeded to the distal arch of the aorta for angiography. Aortography showed a coarcted segment of the descending aorta and PDA flow (). A 4-F non-taper angle catheter (Glidecath, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.035-in. hydrophilic guidewire (Radiofocus, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were inserted via the right common femoral artery and crossed the coarcted segment. The gradient across the coarcted segment was measured as 80 mmHg. Hydrophilic guidewire was replaced with extra stiff Lunderquist guidewire (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA). The sheath in the right femoral artery was replaced with 22-F Dryseal sheath (Japan Gore, Tokyo, Japan). The coarcted segment was dilated by 10×40 cm-sized noncompliant balloon catheter (Mustang, Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan). However, the pressure gradient remained. Then, a 31×100 mm-sized thoracic stent graft (C-TAG, Japan Gore, Tokyo, Japan) was placed over the coarcted segment and PDA. After confirming the optimal position, the stent graft was released and dilated with a 15×40 mm noncompliant balloon catheter (Maxi-LD, Cardinal Health Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The measured gradient across the coarcted segment after the stent placement was 15 mmHg. Aortography revealed good apposition of the thoracic stent graft and complete exclusion of PDA (). No transfusion was required. The patient recovered well, and ABI was 0.90/1.05 postoperatively.\nAt 8 days after the TEVAR, the patient underwent AVR with the mechanical valve (Carbomedics 27 mm, LivaNova Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Since the afterload had been reduced by the TEVAR, extracorporeal circulation was safely managed, and the heart beat recovery was smooth and uneventful. No transfusion was required. The patient recovered well and was discharged 12 days after AVR. The patient remains asymptomatic. CT performed 3 years postoperatively revealed no aneurysm formation or aortic restenosis.",1.68,65.0,23.03

The patient was given mesalizine (Pentasa; 3,000 mg/day) for 2 weeks, and then symptoms were resolved. He was admitted for coughing and exertional dyspnea, however, as well as recurring upper abdominal pain after meals with vomiting and hematochezia developing 5 days before admission (PUCAI: 45). There is no smoking or alcohol drinking except taking mesalizine.\nAt admission, the body scale had body weight of 51 kg (50-75 percentile), height of 165 cm (90-95 percentile). He had blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 88/min, respiration rate of 18/min, body temperature of 36.3℃, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Chest auscultation findings during physical examination were normal, however, tenderness in the epigastrium and hyperactive bowel sound were observed.\nPeripheral blood test results were as following; hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL, white blood cell 10,340/mm2 (neutrophil 69.4%, lymphocyte 18.4%, eosinophil 1.5%), platelet 514,000/mm2, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 22 mm/hr (reference [ref.] 0-15 mm/hr) , and C-reactive protein (CRP) 6.49 mg/dL (ref. 0.0-0.3 mg/dL). Arterial blood gas analysis findings were pH 7.431, pCO2 35.0 mmHg, pO2 93.9 mmHg, HCO3 22.8 mmHg, and SaO2 97.4%. Biochemical examination showed elevated serum levels of lipase at 308 IU/L (ref. 13-60 IU/L). Serum level of triglyceride was 75 mg/dL (ref. 42-168 mg/dL) and no abnormalities were found on renal function test, liver function test or cardiac enzyme test. Fecal occult blood test was positive.\nChest X-ray revealed peripheral reticulonodular opacities in left lung field and thorax computed tomography (CT) showed nodular ground glass opacities in left lower lung zone periphery (). Pulmonary function test showed forced vital capacity (FVC) of 43% (1.56 L) and forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) of 42% (1.41 L) of predicted (FEV1/FVC 91 %), indicating severe restrictive changes ().\nEnlarged pancreas or fluid collection around pancreas, suggestive of acute pancreatic, were not seen on abdominal CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.\nA day after admission, the patient developed a fever of 38.5℃, persistent abdominal pain and hematochezia, suggestive of worsening symptoms of UC. Mesalazine was discontinued and methylprednisolone was intravenously administered at 1 mg/kg/day. Typical therapy for acute pancreatitis was carried out including total parenteral nutrition and fasting. And also an inhalation bronchodilator (salbutamol) was concurrently given for dyspnea.\nFive days after admission, fever, abdominal pain, and hematochezia were resolved. Serum amylase, lipase, ESR and CRP levels decreased to 22 IU/L, 49 IU/L, 15 mm/hr, and 0.24 mg/dL, respectively. Along with gradual diet, mesalizine was resumed for maintaining remission. However, fever and abdominal pain recurred the following day and amylase and lipase levels increased to 148 IU/L, and 325 IU/L, respectively. The patient continued to complain of exertional dyspnea after retry of mesalizine during his hospital days.\nThe hospital course showed that, in our opinion, mesalizine led to complications as pancreatitis and pneumonitis. Fasting was resumed and mesalizine was discontinued. Eleven days after admission, fever and abdominal symptoms were resolved and the amylase level dropped to 45 IU/L. Normal diet was resumed and methylprednisolone therapy was continued without recurrence of symptoms. Dyspnea perceived by the patient also improved after discontinuing mesalizine. Thorax CT showed rapid improvement of nodular ground glass opacities ( and ).\nThirty days after admission, fever, abdominal pain and hematochezia were disappeared. Oral steroid was reduced and balsalazide was initiated to maintain remission. Currently, the patient is on balsalazide only and followed-up at the outpatient ward without special symptoms.",1.65,51.0,18.73
160580,"A 35-year-old man who visited the Department of Family Medicine due to obesity, was referred to the Department of Endocrinology for the evaluation of hormonal abnormalities. The patient's height was 174 cm, his body weight was 135.8 kg, his waist circumference was 137 cm, his hip circumference was 146 cm, and his body mass index was 44.85. He was morbidly obese and had gynecomastia, small testes and penis, and very sparse body hair. He did not report experiencing broken voice and was able to have erections.\nThe level of complete blood cell count were in normal range, white blood cell count 9270/mcL (Neutrophil/Lymphocyte/Monocyte/Eosinophil/Basophil 62.9/20.6/6.1/8.3/0.8%), hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL and platelet 333000/mcL. Routine chemistry showed no specific abnormality other than oral glucose tolerance test, at 2 hours after test glucose was 224 mg/dL. The patient showed increased levels of serum LH (19.88 mIU/mL) and FSH 29.0 (mIU/mL) and decreased levels of serum testosterone (63.0 ng/dL) upon endocrine study. Both testes were reduced in size on testis ultrasounds and there were no sperm present upon sperm analysis. Under the suspicion of primary hypogonadism, we conducted a chromosome study and the patient was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. His genotype was 47,X,+t(X;X)(p22.3;p22.3)del(X)(p11.23q11.2) ( and ). He started treatment with testosterone enanthate injections and was followed up in the outpatient clinic.",1.74,135.8,44.85
34685,"A 47 year old - man was admitted to hospital since he had been complaining about cefalea, dizziness, diplopia and oscillopsia for two days. He had a history of gastric resection with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction due to peptic ulcer ten months before. He had no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. Clinical examination revealed normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. He was well orientated; pupils were equal, round and reactive to light, with marked nystagmus on lateral gaze. He exhibited partial bilateral sixth nerve palsy. He moves all four extremities but he had difficulty to stand and ambulate. No other focal neurological deficit was present. Laboratory studies revealed normal serum sodium, serum chloridre, serum bicarbonate, and serum creatinine. The liver function tests showed normal enzymes and serum bilirubin levels with normal albumin. Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) examinations of the brain were not diagnostic. The spinal fluid cultures were reported as negative. In the suspect of TD, serum thiamine level measurement was programmed but the vitamin was not administered. On the fourteenth day of hospital stay, the patient suddenly experienced chest discomfort, diffuse ST-segment depression in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with ST-segment elevation in aVR and rapidly evolving congestive heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock with serious hypotension (60/40 mmHg), hypothermia, intense perspiration, and coma. His arterial blood showed a significant lactic acidosis and he was immediately given bicarbonate (Table ). The patient developed hemodynamic instability that was refractory to vasoactive drugs followed by unrecoverable cardiac asystole. The day after, the laboratory completed the dosing of the thiamine that resulted equal to 66 nmol/L (n.v. 66 - 200 nmol/L).\nAt autopsy the body was 175 cm height and 70 kg weight. The heart was normal in size (12×8.5×8 cm) and weight (397 g); the coronary vessels and main branches were normal. Histologically, the heart presented focal myocytes necrosis with massive and diffuse polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltrate, especially on the anterior left ventricular samples to demonstrate an early myocardial infarction (Figure ). The heart showed hyper-contraction of the myocell with a breakdown of the whole contractile apparatus with markedly thickened Z-lines and extremely short sarcomeres. This breakdown varied from irregular, pathological and eosinophilic cross-bands consisting of segments of hyper-contracted or coagulated sarcomeres, to a total disruption of myofibrils, the whole cell assuming a granular aspect without visible clear-cut pathological bands. The necrosis was plurifocal, formed by foci ranging from one to thousands of myocardial cells and was found in any cardiac region. Unique bands of 10 to 20 hyper-contracted sarcomeres close to the intercalated disc (paradiscal lesion) were observed too. In addition, the histological sections were analyzed with a confocal microscopy and confirmed the presence of foci of myocardial contraction band necrosis or coagulative myocytolysis visible in all regions of the heart. These pathological changes were formed by paradiscal and pancellular lesions. The latter were formed by segments of hyper-contracted sarcomeres with scalloped sarcolemma. Normal cells around hyper-contracted ones assumed a wavy appearance. No evidence of platelet aggregation or other vessel changes or of interstitial or sarcolemmal alterations existed.",1.75,70.0,22.86
154487,"A 78 kg, 183 cm, 22-year-old male patient was delivered to an operating room for posterolateral lumbar spine fusion at L3-5 and humerus operation. Thirty-five days previously, he was admitted via the emergency department with a diagnosis of multiple traumas after a fall from 10 m. Temporary tracheostomy had been performed twenty days ago for mechanical ventilation to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nPreoperatively, he was alert and able to ventilate via a size 8.0 mm cuffed tracheostomy tube (Portex®, Smiths Medical, Kent, UK) without ventilator assistant. All laboratory test results were normal. There were no upper airway tract abnormalities except tracheostomy, broken upper teeth, and a slight open-bite.\nAfter installing monitors (EKG, pulse oximetry and invasive arterial blood pressure), general anesthesia was induced intravenously with thiopental 325 mg, fentanyl 150 µg, and rocuronium 50 mg. Because he was scheduled for spine surgery in the prone position, the airway was prepared to secure adequate ventilation, as follows: cleansing of the intraoral and endotracheal space with a sterile suction tube, replacing the tracheostomy tube with a size 8.0 mm cuffed flexible tracheal tube (TT) (Safety-Flex®, Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlon, Ireland), confirming the depth of the TT by ballottement and auscultation, staying the TT to the tracheostomy site by suturing with silk 3-0, applying padding to the anterior neck with gauze to prevent sharp angulation of the TT, and draping the anterior neck with transparent dressing (Tegaderm®; 3M, USA).\nAnesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5-3.0 vol% in oxygen with positive pressure ventilation. Continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil 0.1-0.2 µg/kg/min and rocuronium 10 mg/hr followed. After moving the patient to the prone position, the TT and both eyes were checked regularly. The operation was uneventful and took 210 min. After the surgeon requested a wake-up test thirty minutes before the end of spine surgery, rocuronium infusion was stopped to prepare the test, and the concentrations of remifentanil and sevoflurane were decreased to 0.1 µg/kg/min and 0.5 vol%, respectively. These dosages were continued throughout the rest of the procedure to avoid pain and unpleasant memory. However, neuromuscular function and depth of anesthesia monitoring were not applied, as these were not routine. There were no remarkable events before changing the patient's position. As humerus operation was scheduled, it was determined that the patient would be more comfortable in the supine position for the wake-up test.\nAfter closure of spine surgery, the patient was moved into a supine position, and a bite injury to the anterior third of tongue was noticed. The protruding portion of the tongue was cyanotic and edematous, and it seemed that it might be cut if decompression was not employed emergently. The anesthesiologist responsible tried to open the mouth and insert a bite blocker manually after extending the neck. After several attempts to open the mouth failed, sevoflurane concentration was increased to 4.0%, and thiopental 150 mg, midazolam 3 mg, and rocuronium 20 mg were administered intravenously. The mouth began to open slightly approximately thirty seconds after rocuronium administration, and the protruding portion of the tongue was repositioned into the intraoral cavity. Because of inappropriate preparation for the wake-up test and need for emergent tongue decompression requiring deepening of anesthesia level, the proposed wake-up test could not be performed.\nWithin several seconds after decompression, the affected area became pinkish and seemed to be receiving adequate blood supply, and the edema reduced markedly after a manual massage with cold saline-soaked wet gauzes. Horizontal bite marks and a reddish erosive lesion were present on the anterior third of the tongue (). After application of ointment to the erosive area, a bite blocker was inserted. The time between identification and decompression was about five minutes, but the duration of biting could not be estimated. Because no swelling or deep laceration was detected, the humerus operation was started.\nAfter the 280 min operation finished, the patient was sent to an ICU. The patient had no recollection of intraoperative events at follow-up examination and interview. However, the patient complained of mild tongue pain during rest, which was aggravated during movement. The bitten area was pinkish and well circulated, and no hematoma, deep laceration, or movement dysfunction were evident. The patient was discharged thirty days after operation without pain but with some scarring on the right anterolateral one third of the tongue. This scar persisted at seven months after discharge, but there were no other tongue complications.",1.83,78.0,23.29
151385,"A 52-year-old female patient (height 160 cm and weight 60 kg) was scheduled for emergent hip arthroscopic synovectomy and partial labral resection due to acute hematogenous osteomyelitis with abscess. She had been treated with thiazide and angiotensin receptor blocker to control hypertension. A preoperative electrocardiogram indicated a normal sinus rhythm. Preoperative hematocrit was 29.8% and other laboratory findings were within the normal ranges. She had been NPO for 14.5 hours before surgery.\nUpon arriving in the operating room, an initial systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 124/99 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 90 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air were observed. Anesthetic induction was performed using 300 mg of thiopental sodium and 40 mg of rocuronium, followed by tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained using 6.0–7.0 vol% of desflurane with 50% of oxygen using medical air. The surgery was performed while the patient was in the supine position. After surgical draping, the patient's face was observed by the attending anesthesiologist to be free from any external compression throughout the surgery.\nDuring the surgery, the systolic and diastolic BP were kept within the ranges of 95–110 mmHg and 60–80 mmHg, respectively. A normal sinus rhythm was sustained through the surgery, with a HR of 85 beats/ min. The end-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained within the range of 30–35 mmHg. The surgery lasted for 256 minutes, with the administration of Ringer's lactate solution (800 ml). A 3000 ml normal saline for irrigating the arthroscopic field was delivered by an arthroscopic pump (24k® Fluid Management System, ConMED, Largo, FL, USA). At the end of the surgery, the patient was confirmed to be fully awake and was delivered to the post anesthetic care unit (PACU).\nOne hour after arriving at the PACU, she complained of visual impairment in her left eye, saying that she could not detect any light with her left eye. A hematology evaluation indicated a hematocrit value of 25.1%. Immediately after being notified as regard to her visual problem, the patient was referred to an ophthalmologist and diagnosed as most likely having CRAO (). At that time, intraocular pressure (IOP) was 19 mmHg in the left eye that might be caused by swelling of the surrounding tissue. Paracentesis in the anterior chamber of the left eye was performed to increase perfusion pressure to retinal artery perfusion, resulting in decreased IOP to 15 mmHg in the left eye. Three hours after paracentesis, her visual impairment had slightly improved and she could distinguish the outline of objects. On postoperative day 2, the patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve oxygen delivery, combined with topical medications every day for 1 week. On postoperative day 4, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a normal optic pathway and transthoracic echocardiography showed no intra-cardiac shunt and no thrombus. Her visual acuity in the left eye had gradually recovered to 0.8 on postoperative day 5, at which point the IOP was 10 mmHg in the left eye. She was discharged with a visual acuity of 0.8 and IOP of 7 mmHg in the left eye on postoperative day 29.",1.6,60.0,23.44
18316,"The patient is a 41-year-old male. His chief complaint is left flank pain. He has no medical history/family history.\nThe subject consulted a nearby doctor with left stomachache and fever as chief complaints in 1 month prior to the surgery. Diverticulitis of the descending colon splenic flexure was doubted in CT and the subject was hospitalized. A colonoscopy revealed an irregular flat elevated lesion on the splenic flexure. The subject was transferred to our hospital for examination and medical treatment.\nThe height is 175 cm, body weight 54.6 kg, pulse 66 beats/m, body temperature 36.3, and blood pressure 114/76 mmHg. The abdomen was slightly distended, and mild left stomachache was recognized. The stool frequency was 1 time/day.\nIn blood biochemistry examination, values were as high as 22.5 ng/ml in CEA and 81.0 U/ml in CA19-9 tumor markers.\nSignificant hyperplasia (4 cm) of the colon mucous membrane was observed on the descending colon splenic flexure and it was accompanied by elevation of surrounding adipose tissue density. The surrounding lymph nodes swelled up to around 5 mm. Since strong hyperplasia was seen in the mucous membrane, it was thought as reactive enlargement accompanied by inflammation. The finding that indicates distant metastasis was not seen in the liver and lung (Fig. ).\nA semicircular, lateral spreading tumor of granular-type (i.e., an aggregate of IIa-like tumors) was observed in the descending colon splenic flexure (Fig. a).\nNotable abnormality such as irregular ulcer and scar or bamboo joint-formed appearance was not recognized.\nBiopsy was performed twice for the lateral spreading tumor of granular-type of descending colon. The tumor was diagnosed pathologically as a tubular adenoma without evidence of malignancy. However, we judged that the lesion in the descending colon was a cancer based on the elevated CEA level and CT findings. We also considered the possibility of coexistence of inflammatory lesion near the tumor because of an edematous change of the mucosa (Fig. b). Therefore, it was determined to place a covering stoma 20 cm proximal from the terminal ileum at the time of surgery.\nD3 left hemicolectomy and loop type stoma construction were performed. No abnormality was confirmed in the small intestine such as thickness, fistula, mass, and adhesion to abdominal wall during the operation.\nGross examination confirmed that the main tumor was a laterally spreading tumor (granular-type) in the descending colon (Fig. a, b). No gross findings were recognized that supported Crohn’s disease, e.g., longitudinal ulcers, their scars, or cobblestone appearance. Histopathologically, the surface of the main tumor was composed of uniform proliferation of atypical glands (either tubular or villous in configuration) and containing both low- and high-grade areas (Fig. a, b). This lesion stained diffusely positive for p53 by immunohistochemistry (Fig. c). Therefore, we diagnosed these atypical glands in the surface area this as dysplasia, and this lesion continuously invaded the muscularis propria (Fig. d). In deeper areas of the main tumor, deposition of extracellular mucin was observed leading the diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. a). p53 was positive in 50% of tumor cells in mucinous carcinoma (Fig. b). The final diagnosis was mucinous adenocarcinoma associated with dysplasia, in the descending colon, type 5, 50 × 48 mm in size, pT4a (SE) pN2a (4/28), Ly1, V1, cM0, pStage IIIC (UICC TNM classification, 8th ed., and Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma, 9th ed) []. Furthermore, another dysplasia, not continuous from the main tumor, was confirmed by multiple sampling analyses in the resected specimen approximately 5.2 × 1.8 cm in size (indicated by blue line in Figs. and ). This dysplasia was not associated with adenocarcinoma (i.e., completely confined in the mucosa). We further obtained the following findings that supported pre-existing transmural chronic inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease) as follows: (a) irregular thickening of the muscularis mucosae, (b) fibrosis in the submucosa and muscularis propria, and (c) sporadic formation of lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa and subserosa in the resected colon specimen (Fig. ). Taken together, the histopathological features of main tumor were consistent with colitis-associated cancer.\nThe ileus state was prolonged for over 40 days after the surgery. On day 55 endoscopies were performed to newly find orbicular ulcers in the terminal ileum (Fig. a, b). We excluded the possibility of tuberculosis or cytomegalovirus by an interferon-gamma release assay and serum antibody assay. Re-examination of endoscopy on day 77 revealed the development of longitudinal ulcers in the ileum (Fig. c). With a clinical diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, the patient received infliximab administration, and the lesions of small intestine ameliorated significantly on day 103. Furthermore, ileus was improved and therefore the subject was discharged on day 112 (Fig. d). Seventy-three days after the discharge, CEA suddenly was elevated and intestinal edema, and ascitic fluid appeared in abdominal contrast-enhanced CT. The subject was diagnosed as ileus attributable to peritoneal dissemination. Overall status gradually worsened and he passed away on day 207. The final cause of death was judged as peritoneal dissemination.",1.75,54.6,17.83
23864,"A 65-year-old woman showed weakness of the left limbs, lethargy and confusion with no obvious incentive on November 13th, 2017, so she visited a primary hospital and was diagnosed with cerebral infarction by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). She experienced nausea and vomiting intermittently, even developed into poor appetite. Then intravenous hydration was administered and the specific condition was not clear, but the treatment produced little effect. Finally, the patient hospitalized in the Department of Geriatrics of our hospital on December 20th, 2017. At the time of admission, the height of the patient was 158 cm, the weight was 50.0 kg and the BMI was 20.0 kg/m2. Her weight had fallen by 15 kg for about a month. The NRS2002 nutritional risk screening tool scored 5 points.[ She was diagnosed with malnutrition. She suffered from hypertension for years and took levamlodipine besylate tablets orally. She also had a history of type 2 diabetes for more than one year and took metformin hydrochloride tablets orally. In addition, the patient had no history of smoking or alcoholism.\nThe patient cooperated well with the physical examination on admission. She manifested as the decline in numeracy and comprehension, right-left disorientation, tiny right horizontal nystagmus. The left finger-to-nose test was positive, and the heel-knee-tibia test could not be completed. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed gallbladder enlargement and the possibility of cholecystitis with cholestasis. Computerized tomography of the upper abdomen also showed gallbladder enlargement and cholestasis. Cardiac ultrasound revealed mild left atrial enlargement, mild mitral incompetence, and aortic sclerosis. Carotid artery ultrasound indicated bilateral carotid atherosclerosis with plaque formation. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 6.4∗109/L, elevated erythrocyte (5.66∗1012/L), hemoglobin level 145.0 g/L, platelet count 172∗109/L, alanine aminotransferase level 21U/L, aspartate aminotransferase level 22U/L, elevated total bilirubin (36.4 μmol/L), elevated urea nitrogen (9.49mmol/L), creatinine level 61.3 μmol/L, hypokalemia (3.23mmol/L), serum sodium level (137mmol/L), hypochloremia (96.0mmol/L). The patient received intravenous hydration and symptomatic treatment. She received ondansetron to improve nausea and vomiting, with no significant improvement of symptoms. Considering the patient's disease status and nutritional status, the patient was finally given central venous nutrition. Because clinicians lacked systematic cognition of nutrition therapy, the central venous nutrition given to the patient only contained 50% glucose injection, compound amino acid injection (18AA-II), and 20% long chain fat emulsion injection, which made the nutrition imbalanced and vitamin deficient.\nOn January 9th, 2018, the patient was critically ill and suddenly showed cognitive dysfunction, laloplegia, sleep rhythm inversion and then developed into somnolence. Bilateral lower limbs weakness and reduced activity were presented. The muscle strength of the right limbs was at the 1 level, the muscle tone was reduced. The heel-knee-tibia test could not be completed and bilateral babinski signs were positive. Therefore, the suspicion of a recurrence of cerebral infarction or the occurrence of a new lesion could not be ruled out. Acute laboratory results revealed low serum sodium (127mmol/L, normal range: 137–147mmol/L) and low serum chlorine (96mmol/L, normal range: 99–110mmol/L) levels, so hyponatremia and hypochloraemia should also be considered to be involved in altered mental status. Finally, MRI of the brain revealed abnormal signal in the dorsal thalamus, mamillary bodies, periaqueductal gray matter, left central anterioposterior cortex (Fig. ), which was consistent with the diagnosis of WE.[\nAfter confirmed the diagnosis, the patient received 100 mg of thiamine intramuscularly 3 times daily for 9 days and then 100 mg of thiamine intramuscularly two times daily for 4 days. At the same time, the patient asked for consultation of Department of Nutrition. We firstly recommended a gradual transition from parenteral nutrition to enteral nutrition to restore her intestinal function gradually. Considering that she had dysphagia and poor food intake due to cerebral infarction, we suggested to use an indwelling nasogastric tube. Initially, she was given partial parenteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition for 6 days. That is 250 mL of compound amino acids (18AA-II) was administered once daily in partial parenteral nutrition. As for partial enteral nutrition, the intacted protein-based enteral nutrition powder was prepared into a nutrition solution with a concentration of 20% to 25%, and pumped into the nasogastric tube at a constant speed. Then, according to the patient's gastrointestinal tolerance, she gradually transitioned to total enteral nutrition, that is, the compound amino acid injection (18AA-II) was replaced by whey protein powder. In the first 3 days of the start of nutrition therapy, she was given 900 kcal of energy and 50 g of protein. Then, the energy and protein supplements were increased to 1300 kcal and 70 g, respectively. In addition, considering her long-term poor diet, she was given water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins and trace elements supplements in enteral nutrition. Interestingly, after regular thiamine and nutritional treatment, her cognitive impairment, laloplegia and sleep condition significantly improved within 4 days. Her neurological status continued to improve and physical activity gradually recovered within 2 weeks. Subsequently, the patient, whose condition was relatively stable, was given 10 mg of thiamine orally three times daily and transitioned from enteral nutrition to food homogenate (low-salt and low-fat diabetes homogenate). As expected, her nutrition-related laboratory indicators and electrolytes gradually returned to normal level. Laboratory data are shown in Table .\nOn January 17th, 2018, the patient was transferred to Department of Rehabilitation Medicine for further rehabilitation training, and her muscle strength of limbs increased gradually. As her swallowing function gradually recovered, the nasogastric tube was removed and the oral diet was started. The patient finally achieved the goal of rehabilitation and was discharged on February 9th, 2018.\nThe patient provided informed consent for publication of the case report.",1.58,50.0,20.03
141002,"A 77-year-old man (height, 168 cm; weight, 70 kg) presented at our hospital with black tarry stool. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and a gastric intestinal stromal tumor 4 cm in size was detected. Thereafter, endoscopic full-thickness gastric resection (EFTGR) was planned. EFTGR can be regarded as a hybrid form of NOTES or as an intermediate form step since a full-thickness incision in the gastric wall is made endoscopically and closure is achieved laparoscopically. We planned the surgery in such a way that endoscopic resection of the tumor would be performed by an endoscopic operator experienced in internal medicine and the laparoscopic dissection and closure of the stomach would be performed by a general surgeon.\nThe patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and he been taking medicines for these disorders. His preoperative routine laboratory values were within the normal range and a preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia of 58 beats/min. The patient was premedicated with 1 mg of butorphanol and 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate intramuscularly before surgery. His vital signs were stable upon arrival at the operating room and were monitored thereafter using ECG (lead II), pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO2), and noninvasive blood pressure (BP) determination Because the endoscopes were placed in his mouth, the patient's temperature was measured using a skin temperature probe.\nAnesthesia was induced using 120 mg of propofol, 50 mg of rocuronium, and 100 µg of fentanyl and nasotracheal intubation was performed using a nasal RAETM tracheal tube with a 7.5 mm inner diameter (ID), because nasotracheal intubation is convenient for endoscopic procedures. General anesthesia was maintained using O2 at 2 L/min, N2O at 2 L/min, and 1.5-2.5 vol% of sevoflurane, and the concentration of sevoflurane was controlled using the bispectral index. Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 ml and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min was maintained. After induction, the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and ETCO2 were 16-17 cmH2O and 35-37 mmHg, respectively.\nThe patient was placed in the supine position while the laparoscopic operator remained on the right side of the patient to insert the port and perform the stomach dissection. A pneumoperitoneum was created using carbon dioxide (CO2) gas at a pressure of 14 mmHg throughout the surgery. After CO2 injection, the ETCO2 increased up to 40 mmHg, and hence, the respiratory rate was controlled; however, no change was made to the tidal volume as the PIP was maintained at 23-25 mmHg. After laparoscopic dissection, the endoscopic operator moved into position near the patient's head to perform an endoscopic full-thickness resection of the tumor with sufficient surgical margins (). During endoscopic resection, visibility was ensured through air insufflations, and the PIP pressure was approximately 5-7 mmHg lower than that measured during the laparoscopic procedure using CO2. After confirming no active bleeding, the endoscope was removed, and the laparoscopic operator performed closure of the stomach and sutured the skin wound.\nDuring the entire procedure, hemodynamic stability was maintained and ETCO2 was maintained at 32-37 mmHg. The time required for the laparoscopy was 70 min and that for the endoscopy was 60 min; the anesthesia time was 160 min. Upon completion of the surgery, the patient was transferred to the general ward. No specific complications were observed during the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4.",1.68,70.0,24.8
136131,"A 61-year-old man (172 cm, 64 kg) with no underlying disease was scheduled to undergo right thyroidectomy for a 6-cm-sized thyroid mass. This mass was a nonfunctional tumor, so no medication was needed. On preoperative evaluation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated normal sinus rhythm, and a laboratory evaluation including a thyroid function test (TFT) revealed normal findings. On chest X-ray, the lungs were essentially clear, but there was significant left-sided displacement of the trachea at level T1–2 due to a large thyroid mass.\nIn an operating room, after placement of routine monitoring, he was sedated with propofol (70 mg) and infusion of remifentanil at a rate of 0.15 μg/kg/min. Rocuronium (50 mg) was administered to achieve muscle relaxation for intubation. On laryngoscopic view, the vocal cord was deviated to the left side, as confirmed by chest X-ray at preanesthetic evaluation. The trachea was deviated, but not narrowed, so there was no difficulty during intubation when using a 7.5-mm endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and an oxygen–air mixture. Fifteen minutes after initiating the surgery, his blood pressure suddenly decreased to 70/50 mmHg. Intravenous ephedrine and phenylephrine were administered, but no effect was observed. The same doses of vasoactive drugs were injected, and his blood pressure only improved to 90/60 mmHg and then decreased again. Repeated doses of ephedrine and phenylephrine showed no effect, so we asked the surgeon to discontinue the surgery, and then initiated an infusion of dopamine at a rate of 5 μg/kg/min and phenylephrine at 0.5 μg/kg/min. An arterial cannulation was placed in the left radial artery and a 16-gauge peripheral line was added in the right foot. His blood pressure gradually increased to 150/80 mmHg. There was no sign of multiorgan failure. The saturation was 100%, and there was no change in the ECG. After stabilization of blood pressure, the surgery was resumed. The surgeon manipulated the superior pole of the thyroid gland, and the blood pressure dropped again, while the heart rate increased. After removing the thyroid gland, the patient's vital signs stabilized during the surgery, and we could complete the surgery without encountering any other problems.\nHe remained hemodynamically stable in the postanesthesia care unit. Postoperative laboratory findings including troponin I and TFT results were within normal limits. On the day after surgery, a T-wave abnormality was newly found on the ECG, but the echocardiogram was normal with an ejection fraction of 56% and no regional wall motion abnormality. Five days after the surgery, the patient was discharged without any other problems. One month later, a myocardial perfusion imaging test showed no evidence of ischemia. Histological diagnosis revealed a thyroid mass as a follicular carcinoma, but no evidence of catecholamine-secreting tissues.",1.72,64.0,21.63
28433,"A 50-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for Lyme disease, babesiosis, Graves’ disease with hyperthyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NASH), chemical sensitivity, supraventricular tachycardia requiring cardiac ablation, left knee arthroscopic surgery for a torn meniscus, status post MVA with neck torsion, ADD, and bilateral cataract surgery presented to our office for a Lyme consultation in July 2010. She had a history of at least 10 tick bites and spent much of her life in heavily Lyme disease and Babesia endemic areas such as Martha’s Vineyard. Approximately 10 years ago, she began to develop multiple symptoms including significant fatigue, night sweats, joint pain, swollen glands, neck pain and stiffness, headaches, palpitations, shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. She went to see a local endocrinologist and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. She was placed on methimazole, which controlled her abnormal thyroid functions, but her health never returned to normal. One year later, her local physician diagnosed her with Lyme disease based on her symptoms and a CDC positive IgM and IgG Lyme Western blot. She was placed on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID and felt much better. She then went to see a local infectious disease specialist, who placed her on tetracycline HCL and hydroxychloroquine, but she did not feel well on this regimen and returned to her local physician to go back on doxycycline. She completed 4 months of antibiotic therapy and achieved between 70% and 80% of normal functioning. She then was rotated to azithromycin and rifampin for ongoing resistant symptoms but did not feel as well with this protocol, and she went to see a physician specializing in Lyme disease for a second opinion. Her testing returned positive for Babesia and Borrelia burgdorferi, and she was rotated to atovaquone and azithromycin. On this protocol her sweats got better, but otherwise there was a steady regression of her baseline underlying symptoms. She was therefore switched to amoxicillin 5 to 6 weeks before our initial consultation, titrating the dose upwards. Although she initially responded well, with a significant decrease in symptoms for the first 2 weeks, she then had a steroid injection in her neck for her chronic pain and severely relapsed; this was followed by a chemical exposure with hair straightening products, which also significantly worsened her symptomatology. At the time of our initial consultation, she felt much worse before starting her Lyme disease and Babesia therapy and was functioning at 10% of her normal functioning.\nChief complaints during the initial history and physical were fevers, sweats, chills, and flushing; weight gain; fatigue; sore throat and swollen glands; unexplained menstrual irregularity; loss of libido; upset stomach with constipation; chest pain/rib soreness with shortness of breath and an unexplained cough; palpitations; migratory joint pain in the knees, neck, hips, and ankles with neck and back stiffness; myalgias; headaches with intermittent migraines; tingling, numbness, burning, or stabbing sensations of the extremities; blurry vision; tinnitus and increased motion sickness; dizziness with poor balance; tremors; confusion with difficulty thinking; difficulty with concentration or reading; forgetfulness with poor short-term memory; disorientation and getting lost, going to the wrong places; difficulty with speech and writing; mood swings with irritability, anxiety, and depression; insomnia with early awakening; and exaggerated symptoms from alcohol use. Review of systems also revealed problems with a chronic postnasal drip, occasional wheezing, early satiety, and stress incontinence. Medication included methimazole 5 mg BID, amoxicillin 875 mg, 3 PO once daily (QD), Imitrex PRN, nystatin 500,000 units 3 PO QD, an estradiol patch, and progesterone 100 mg HS, as well as various vitamin and mineral supplements.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except for an enlarged thyroid gland, consistent with Graves’ disease, and some left elbow tenderness on palpation. Laboratory testing done during the initial consultation included assessing thyroid functions; testing DHEA/cortisol; measuring vitamin and mineral levels; evaluating for heavy metal exposure (mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, aluminum); checking for food allergies; and expanding her tick-borne panel for exposure to Q fever, RMSF, and tularemia, as well as checking for exposure to Bartonella, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Heavy metal testing returned showing elevated levels of lead (25 µg/g creatinine, normal range < 2) and mercury (17 µg/g creatinine, normal range < 4), and adrenal testing revealed phase 2 adrenal dysfunction with low cortisol in the morning (0.20 ng/mL, normal range 1–8.0 ng/mL) and at 2 p.m. (0.46 ng/mL, normal range 1–8.0 ng/mL). She was therefore placed on dietary restrictions, and told to decrease intake of larger fish, along with alpha lipoic acid 600 mg PO BID, and low-dose hydrocortisone in the morning and at noon (5 mg PO BID) with adaptogenic herbs (B vitamins, ashwagandha, rhodiola). These measures improved her energy/stamina. Since she had a significant improvement during the first 2 weeks on amoxicillin therapy before her steroid injection, she was placed on benzathine penicillin (Bicillin LA) 1.2 million units twice a week, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg PO BID, clarithromycin XL 500 mg PO BID, and atovaquone/proguanil 1 PO QD, along with probiotic support. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 2 mg HS was added for anti-inflammatory effects, and she was also started on bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) 150 mg PO BID for depression. She responded well to the Bicillin injections and oral antibiotics and remained on this therapy for the next several months. She also was eventually started on valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, rosuvastatin for hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 317, triglycerides 253, HDL 47, LDL 219), and metoprolol XL 25 mg 1 QD for palpitations (a 24-h Holter monitor revealed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) without supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A stress echocardiogram was done for her chest pain and cardiac risk factors, which showed no ischemic changes, and a Doppler/ultrasound of the carotids showed no evidence of plaque or stenosis. A low-carbohydrate, paleo-style diet was prescribed for significant weight gain (5 ft 7 in., 206 lbs) with hyperinsulinemia (70.7 uIU, normal < 24.9 uIU), hyperuricemia (uric acid 8.2. normal range < 6.0 mg/dL), elevated hs-CRP (3.7 mg/L, normal < 1), and a CT abdomen suggestive of a fatty liver.\nOver the following several years, due to ongoing resistant symptoms, the patient was rotated through multiple antibiotic regimens including various oral cephalosporins (cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir), metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin, rifampin, and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin). Although there were temporary improvements in symptomatology with these protocols, as well as improvements using rotations of antimalarial therapy for babesiosis for ongoing sweats (lumefantrine/artemether (Coartem), clindamycin), she would relapse with an increase in her baseline symptoms each time she was taken off therapy. In May 2017, her primary care physician decided to institute a trial of IV ceftriaxone, 2 g QD, along with DDS CT, for increased Borrelia specific banding on her Western blot (23 kDa, Osp C) accompanied by resistant symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and severe ongoing memory/concentration problems off treatment.\nShe was placed back on DDS CT with minocycline 100 mg PO BID, pulse rifampin 300 mg, 2 PO BID one day/week (for GI tolerance), and dapsone, slowly increasing doses to 100 mg/day with leucovorin 25 mg BID and L-methyl folate 15 mg/day. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), alpha lipoic acid (ALA), and liposomal glutathione (GSH) were given twice a day for inflammation and detoxification support with triple biofilm agents (Serrapeptase, monolaurin, Stevia) and triple probiotics. Rifabutin 150 mg PO BID eventually was used instead of rifampin, with better GI tolerance. She improved with this protocol, and by June 2017, 1 month later, she had significantly less fatigue and musculoskeletal pain and improved cognition, functioning at 90% of normal. Cognitive problems were still present, but slowly improving, and IV glutathione (GSH) was highly effective for both Herxheimer reactions and resistant brain fog, relieving her symptomatology within 15 min of an IV infusion. Her PCP therefore left her on the same protocol until she decided to go to Germany for hyperthermia treatment in early August 2017.\nShe was taken off her DDS CT by the German physicians and left on IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole, with low-dose niacin, while being given IV ozone and stem cells during her visit. She tolerated the treatment well and felt an improvement after the second course of hyperthermia. Upon returning to the United States, despite jet lag, her joint pain and flexibility as well as her cognition had improved, so we removed the PICC line, stopped all antibiotics, and administered 2 months of mitochondrial support with glycosylated phospholipids (NT Factors), CoQ10, and acetyl-L-carnitine, adding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) if fatigue were to persist. During an in-office follow-up 2 months later, she was still gradually improving, only complaining of mild fatigue, mild cognitive problems, and neck pain. Babesia symptoms were gone, and a repeat Babesia titer was negative. Repeat adrenal function with a DHEA/cortisol test also showed that she no longer suffered from adrenal fatigue, even off low-dose hydrocortisone.\nIn December 2017, after 4–5 months off IV and oral antibiotics and post hyperthermia treatment, she began to have a relapse of underlying symptoms. These included fatigue, flushing, increased neck pain, blurry vision, and ongoing memory/concentration problems. There were also new, unexplained allergy symptoms that were arising, with an intermittent red face and swollen lips. She went for an allergy evaluation, and we checked an IgE food panel and antibodies against the alpha gal allergen, which were all negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck did not reveal any structural cause for her neck pain, and an eye examination was performed for her blurry vision, which was WNL. Since the patient’s symptoms were not yet severe, she decided to try an alternative treatment regimen with her PCP, using alpha and beta thymosin injections, which gave some relief of symptoms during a 3-month trial. The flushing also resolved off niacin, and she was given fenofibrate (Tricor) 145 mg instead for her hypertriglyceridemia, but this was stopped 3 days later secondary to a possible allergic reaction with ongoing facial erythema.\nThe patient had a telemedicine consult April 2018, since she continued to slowly relapse 9 months off antibiotics. She had gone from 90% down to 60% of normal functioning, with increasing fatigue, neck pain with neuralgia on the right side of the neck, head pressure, and increased brain fog. Since her G6PD levels were WNL (239, normal range between 46–376 U) with a normal CBC (H/H 14.5/42.2) and no baseline elevations in methemoglobin (0.3% normal range < 1.9%), we discussed a trial of DDD CT, starting at the beginning of May 2018. After signing an informed consent, she began doxycycline 200 mg PO BID, rifampin 300 mg PO BID, gradually increasing doses of dapsone until at 100 mg BID, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg PO BID, nystatin 500,000 units 2 PO BID, cimetidine 400 mg PO BID, and leucovorin 25 mg BID with 15 mg of L-methyl folate during month 1, increasing L-methyl folate to 25 mg PO BID month 2. This was along with triple biofilm agents and triple probiotics with NAC, ALA, and GSH. A CBC, CMP, and methemoglobin levels were drawn every 2 weeks during the 1st month of treatment and weekly during the 2nd month of DDD CT, at which point she would stop the therapy and remain on biofilm agents, folic acid, and probiotics.\nBy July 2018, the patient had completed DDD CT, having missed the last week of treatment secondary to gastrointestinal upset. She was functioning at 90% of normal and reported feeling the best she had felt in the past 20 years. Her CBC had slightly decreased on dapsone while remaining on high-dose folic acid (H/H 13.6/40.5), and there was no significant methemoglobinemia on glutathione 1000 mg twice a day (methemoglobin 0.3%, normal < 1.9%). Fatigue and nerve pain had completely resolved, generalized arthralgias and myalgias were gone, except for some residual neck pain, moods were significantly better with decreased anxiety, and brain fog was mild, but improved. As of November 2018, she remained at a higher level of functioning than before doing DDD CT, although she had slipped from 90% to 85% of normal functioning. Her anxiety was returning along with palpitations, mild fatigue, neck stiffness, bladder dysfunction with urgency and frequency (history of a dropped bladder), and difficulty concentrating and reading. Laboratory values 6 months post DDD CT in December 2018 were also WNL (H/H 14.4/42.7) with a normal creatinine (0.9, normal < 0.95) and normal liver functions, despite the history of fatty liver (AST 26, normal < 34 U/L; ALT 37, normal < 36).\nAs of March 2019, most of her baseline Lyme symptoms had resolved, but she still complained of some fatigue and daily morning headaches, which would promptly resolve with 400 mg of ibuprofen. She was placed on a stricter hypoglycemic diet for her hyperinsulinemia and occasional low blood sugars on her CMP (glucose 62). By August 2019, the patient felt she was in complete remission, at 100% of her normal functioning, with no further Lyme symptoms. Only residual neck stiffness remained, which was felt to be due to her status post MVA with multiple neck traumas falling off horses. Her fatigue and headaches had resolved with a stricter hypoglycemic diet, and her urinary and bowel problems (constipation) also improved post total abdominal hysterectomy, for fibroids that were compressing her bladder and colon. It was the best she had ever felt since falling ill 20 years ago. As of August 2020, she had remained off antibiotics for over 2 years, with no further relapse of symptoms of chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS.\nThese three patients represent a snapshot of the effects of DDD CT therapy. In order to demonstrate the potential for this treatment to improve long-term tick-borne symptoms, we completed a retrospective chart review of an additional 37 patients for a total of 40 patients. The regimen was offered to approximately 100 patients, and we chose 40 patients who had completed the protocol at least 1 year prior in order to evaluate their remission and improvement status. All of the patients in this chart review had been ill for at least 1 year and had been treated by multiple health-care providers, failing traditional antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease, which included but was not limited to tetracyclines, macrolides, penicillins, and cephalosporins. Patients were given a standardized protocol sheet after determining eligibility. The DDD CT care plan is shown in .",1.702,93.4,32.26
128352,"A 36-year-old white male (weight 71 kg, height 175 cm) with hypertension, type I diabetes, heart disease, and on hemodialysis 51 months prior to this incident, developed MRSA bacteremia as shown by both CVC (which was inserted 1 week before the incidence of infection due to poor blood flow) and peripheral line blood cultures. The patient was treated with vancomycin 1,000 mg i.v. (14 mg/kg) initially, then 1,500 mg (21 mg/kg) after the subsequent dialysis (due to low trough level) followed by 1,000 mg i.v. after each subsequent dialysis with pre-hemodialysis concentrations > 15 mg/L (MRSA MIC was 0.5 mg/mL). Treatment was initiated in the inpatient setting and was completed in the outpatient dialysis unit. The patient was also treated with vancomycin (2.5 mg/mL)/4% citrate lock solution for a 2-week period. Microbiological eradication and resolution of symptoms were observed. The catheter was removed 1 month later after the patient had a successful kidney transplant.",1.75,71.0,23.18
20861,"A 37-year-old, 60 kg, and 160 cm man was diagnosed with loosening of fixation screws to L4-L5 and scheduled for surgical removal under general anesthesia. He was otherwise well, without history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, or chest pain. The last general anesthesia for screw implantation procedure was uneventful. Preoperative electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and no sign of myocardial ischemia (Fig. ); chest X-ray was unremarkable; blood tests showed hemoglobin 14.7 g/dL and hematocrit 43.8%; and other laboratory findings were within normal ranges except for slightly elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (51 IU/L). The patient was American Society of Anaesthesiologists’ (ASA) classification I.\nThe patient was monitored during anesthesia, using ECG, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), and noninvasive arterial blood pressure. Preoperative blood pressure (BP) was 130/87 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 75 bpm, body temperature 36.1 °C, and SpO2 98%. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl (total 350 μg), propofol 120 mg, rocuronium 50 mg, and sevoflurane (1.5–2.5%). The surgery went uneventfully throughout the whole of 60 min of operation, with the patient on prone position, estimated blood loss of 100 mL, and without any complications. No significant changes in respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological parameters was noted through the surgery.\nUpon completion of the surgery, the patient was changed to the supine position. Ten minutes after discontinuation of sevoflurane, the patient was awake with HR 86 bpm, BP 135/85 mmHg, SpO2 100% on spontaneous breathing, and ready for extubation. During endotracheal tube (ETT) aspiration, ECG suddenly changed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and fast ventricular response (HR 170–180 bpm), ST segment elevation (0.4–0.5 mV, max 0.6 mV), and BP decreased to 105/54 mmHg. Immediate setup of invasive hemodynamic monitoring lines showed arterial pressure of 85/40 mmHg and central venous pressure of 8 mmHg.\nThe patient was immediately sedated and mechanically ventilated with midazolam and fentanyl. Intravenous heparin (bolus of 4000 IU, then infusion at 600 IU/h) and amiodarone (bolus 150 mg, then infusion at 5 mg/kg/h) were given. Noradrenaline 0.03–0.1 μg/kg/min was infused to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60–70 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal left ventricular wall motion and dimension (LVEDd 41 mm), with left ventricular ejection fraction of 57%. There was no right ventricular strain, pericardial effusion, or other pathology. 12-Lead ECG at 10 min after onset of ST elevation showed AF, ST elevation in DI, DII, aVF, and ST depression in V1, V2, aVR, and right precordial (V3R, V4R, V5R, and V6R) leads (Fig. ). Arterial blood gas analysis showed mild metabolic acidosis (pH 7.38; PaCO2 30 mmHg; HCO3− 18 mmol/L; BE − 6 mmol/L), normal serum electrolytes.\nTachycardia persisted with elevated ST segment during 10 min. Subsequently, HR- and ST-segment elevation gradually decreased (Table ), and the noradrenaline dose was also slowly decreased.\nAfter 4 h in the operating room, the patient was hemodynamically stable without noradrenaline. He was back on spontaneous breathing and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Extubation was performed several hours later. Subsequent laboratory investigations showed elevation of Troponin-I and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels (Table ). Computed tomography coronary angiography showed the stenosis in the middle left anterior descending (LAD) (50%) and the middle circumflex coronary artery (LCx) (50%) (Fig. ). Repeated TTE in ICU showed no significant wall motion abnormality. The heart returned to sinus rhythm, and HR and MAP were within normal limits after 24 h. The patient remained stable with normal sinus rhythm, chest pain-free, and downtrend in troponin-I and CK-MB levels. The patient was bridged to dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg daily. He was transferred to a general ward after 7 days in ICU and discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy at postoperative day 10 without any complications.",1.6,60.0,23.44
37571,"A 38-year-old woman with a childhood history of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis came to our outpatient clinic because of polyarthralgia and swelling of her fingers. Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever (). Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall. She had no rash except for a malar erythema that was faint at that time. All her fingers were swollen, but her wrist, shoulder, and knee joints were not. Both her legs had pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory data showed mild hypoproteinemia (serum protein 6.4 g/dL) and slightly decreased peripheral white blood cell count (4,100/μL). However, other hematologic parameters were relatively normal (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, reticulocyte 1.4%, and platelet count 230,000/μL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Regardless of hypocomplementemia (C3 72 mg/dL, C4 9 mg/dL, and CH50 18.6 U/mL), the tests for serum antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Althoughthe IgG antibody was not examined, a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody (index 7.97) indicated a recent infection of the virus []. Since microbiological tests for other viruses, such as measles and rubella, were negative, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was finally made. Because her symptoms deteriorated despite the use of acetaminophen, oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was alternatively started immediately after the diagnosis (). The symptoms, including facial erythema, polyarthralgia, and the swelling of her fingers, rapidly disappeared within 12 hours after the initiation of the drug. No recurrence of the symptoms or signs was noted afterwards, indicating the complete remission of the disease.",1.53,48.0,20.5
92174,"A 32-year-old man (white, 75 kg, 182 cm and non-smoker) presented to our emergency department with a 24 hours history of increasing pain on the lateral aspect of his left foot. The patient was unable to bear weight on the affected side, but there was no history of trauma to the ankle. Also no medical history was mentioned.\nClinical examination revealed localised tenderness proximal to the base of the fifth metatarsal, under the surface of the cuboid, in the line of the peroneus longus tendon, associated with warmth and redness. Although there was a full range of motion at the ankle, sub-talar and midfoot joint, but foot passive forced supination and active pronation under resistance produced pain exacerbation.\nA plain lateral radiograph showed homogeneous calcification at the lateral aspect of foot, under the surface of the cuboid in the line of the peroneus longus tendon (). Laboratory examination showed white blood cells (WBC) = 12100/μl, C-reactive protein (CRP) = 3.1 mg/dl and erythrocytes segmentation rate (ESR) = 10 mm/h.\nThe patient was treated with a single dose of steroid injection (3 mg Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate + 3 mg Betamethasone Dipropionate mixed with 3 ml xylocaine) delivered at the area of maximum tenderness, following by ankle rest. After injection, the patient obtained dramatic relief from pain and was discharged the next day.\nAt review two weeks, 6 months and two years later the patient was remained without symptoms. A radiograph obtained after 6 months showed that the area of calcification had disappeared.",1.82,75.0,22.64
120458,"An 86-year-old man diagnosed with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis type B and alcohol abuse was investigated for the presence of esophageal varices at the time of a follow-up visit to the Department of Gastroenterology at our hospital. He had a history of left-sided intramuscular hemorrhage of unknown etiology, a year prior to presentation. He had been diagnosed with polycythemia vera at the age of 74 years, but he did not relate any remarkable family history. A physical examination revealed he was 150 cm tall and weighed 55 kg. An examination of his palpebral conjunctiva did not reveal an anemic state, and his bulbar conjunctiva did not show signs of icterus. His heart and respiratory sounds were normal, and his liver and spleen were not palpable. A laboratory workup revealed a red blood cell count of 5.36 × 106/μL, a hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 42.8 × 104/μL, and his prothrombin time was prolonged in 60%. However, his von Willebrand factor (vWF) was normal. The serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated to 44 and 40 U/L, respectively; however, the serum albumin, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were decreased (Table ). His hepatic reserve showed a Child-Pugh class B.\nWe performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to assess for any gastrointestinal complications associated with liver cirrhosis. The endoscopy showed erythema and cherry red spots in the lower part of the esophagus (Fig. ). On the second day after admission, he underwent endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with injection of ethanolamine oleate into the variceal veins to prevent bleeding from the esophageal varices (Fig. ). After the endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy, the patient developed epigastric abdominal pain and reported tarry stool. The following day, we performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to identify the source of the bleeding leading to the tarry stool. A huge hematoma was detected at the puncture site through which the sclerotherapy had been administered, and we performed endoscopic variceal ligation using an O-ring (Fig. ). A laboratory workup revealed that his red blood cell count had decreased to 4.6 × 106/μL, his hemoglobin level had dropped to 11.7 g/dL, and his platelet count was significantly increased to 98.8 × 104/μL, for which he received urgent blood transfusion.\nThe following day, the patient complained of severe left-sided dull pain, and had difficulty with breathing. An emergency enhanced CT revealed a massive left-sided pleural effusion, which was suspected to be caused by extravasation from vessels present along the left lung ligament (Fig. ). Another laboratory workup revealed that his red blood cell count had further decreased to 3.4 × 106/μL, his hemoglobin level had further dropped to 8.9 g/dL, and the platelet count had risen to 95.1 × 104/μL.\nOn the third day of hospitalization, the patient underwent an emergency thoracotomy, which revealed massive bloody pleural effusion and a huge hematoma in the left thoracic cavity (Fig. ). A pulmonary ligament was bulging and ripping because of the mediastinal hematoma, and oozing was noted. The responsible vessel for hemothorax was not clearly identified. We sutured the lacerated portion of the left pulmonary ligament. After removal of the huge hematoma, he received blood transfusion, and no further bleeding was observed. A further laboratory workup revealed that his red blood cell count had returned to 3.7 × 106/μL, his hemoglobin level had returned to 10.7 g/dL, and the platelet count was 31.3 × 104/μL. The patient was placed in the intensive medical care unit for observation and medical management.\nOn the eighth day of hospitalization, he was transferred to the general ward. A CT examination showed that his left-sided massive pleural effusion had decreased (Fig. ), and endoscopy revealed thrombus formation in the variceal veins in addition to the presence of a post-banding ulcer after use of the elastic O-ring (Fig. ). He was discharged from the hospital 10 days after surgery for evacuation of the mediastinal hematoma.",1.5,55.0,24.44
87441,"Ten-year-old Japanese boy with past medical history of Hemoglobin Evans [alpha2 62(E11) Val→Met] and asymptomatic gallbladder stones was admitted for epigastric abdominal pain. He had reported nothing out of the ordinary until the day before admission, when he experienced acute-onset abdominal pain and emesis. The pain subsided spontaneously after several hours, but recurred soon after breakfast the next morning. The pain was continuously located in the epigastric region. The patient described the pain as 8 on a scale of 0–10, with 10 indicating the severest pain. A review of systems showed the patient positive for general malaise, nonbiliary vomiting, and conjunctiva which are slightly more yellowish than his usual state. There was no fever, back pain, altered mental status, or chest pain.\nHis past medical history was significant for a heterozygous in-frame mutation of Hemoglobin Evans [alpha2 62(E11) Val→Met]. He had been followed up by a pediatric hematologist for resultant mild hemolytic anemia and indirect-bilirubin-dominant jaundice (total bilirubin 4–6 mg/dL), but was otherwise healthy with normal motor and cognitive development. When he was 8-years old, aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection occurred. At that time, an abdominal ultrasonography revealed asymptomatic gallbladder stones. He took daily folic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. Both his mother and his brother carried the same heterozygous mutation.\nOn examination, the patient was not in acute distress. His height was 133 cm and his weight was 30.5 kg. He was afebrile, his heart rate was 62 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, and his extremities were warm. The skin and conjunctiva were icteric. The abdomen was soft and flat without guarding. He reported epigastric tenderness on palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Murphy's sign was negative.\nLaboratory studies revealed marked hyperbillirubinemia and elevated liver and biliary function, with T-Bil of 13.9 mg/dL, D-Bil of 4.5 mg/dL, AST 371 U/L, ALT 438 U/L, LDH 419 U/L, ALP 929 U/L, and g-GT 71 U/L. There was no leukocytosis (WBC 7950/μL), or any elevation of serum amylase (Amy 58 U/L). Normocytic anemia and reticulocytosis (Hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, MCV 95.6 fL, reticulocyte 12.7%) were unchanged from his previous visit. An abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan were conducted in order to determine the cause of the obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography revealed a dilated common bile duct (3.6 mm in diameter), but failed to reveal the cause of the obstruction. The CT scan showed multiple, radiopaque shadows in the lower common bile duct as well as in the gallbladder. The pancreatic duct was not dilated.\nThe diagnosis of choledocholithiases and obstructive jaundice was made. Once oral intake was stopped, the abdominal tenderness disappeared quickly. The jaundice worsened, however, over the next 4 days and reached T-bil/D-Bil of 25.6/14.2 mg/dL, respectively. A refractory, itchy irritation of the skin developed. We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on 6th day of hospitalization. Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation, followed by stone removal procedure using a basket and an extractor balloon resulted in extraction of a small bilirubin stone to the duodenum. Although cholangiography after the stone removal revealed no definite residual stones, a biliary stent (Flexima™ biliary stent system, 7 Fr, 5 cm; Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was placed in order to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Jaundice and general malaise subsided after the procedure. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiography were performed 10 days after the ERCP. Intraoperative cholangiography revealed a new choledocholithiasis adjacent to the patent biliary stent placed during the first ERCP. Attempts to remove the stone failed. The gallbladder contained many black pigment stones of several millimeters in size. He was discharged without symptoms.\nThe remaining bilirubin choledocholithiasis was removed during the second ERCP, performed 4 months after the cholecystectomy. Although cholangiography after stone retrieval showed no evidence of remaining biliary stones, a biliary stent was kept in place for 2 more months to prevent any possible biliary obstruction, and was finally removed 2 months after the second ERCP. The symptoms have not recurred to date.",1.33,30.5,17.24
90708,"A 24-year-old white male smoker, previously healthy, presented to the emergency room (ER) of the Makassed General Hospital with abdominal pain of several days duration. The patient was 173 cm in height and weighed 85 kg. He described his pain as dull and continuous, worsening from time to time, mainly involving the epigastric area, radiating bilaterally to the back and associated with nausea and vomiting. Curiously, his pain was not provoked by food intake.\nThe patient had no history of alcohol intake. He exercised regularly and reported taking testosterone injections three times weekly for the past 2 months. He also reported the intake of diuretics and amino acid supplements. The patient reported no intake of other vitamin and mineral supplements.\nPhysical examination was normal except for diffuse abdominal tenderness elicited even with light palpation. Primary laboratory analysis showed leukocytosis with left shift, hypercalcemia, mildly elevated liver enzymes, elevated creatinine level, and a significant increase in the levels of amylase, lipase and creatine protein kinase (CPK) (Table ). Negative ketones in the blood and normal urine analysis were read. An elevated serum calcium level of 13.8 mg/dl was measured, whereas the measured albumin level was near normal (3.3 g/dl). Taken together, these two values show a corrected calcium level of nearly 14.3 mg/dl. Further analysis showed a low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level indicating a suppressed parathyroid function as well as an increased level of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D.\nThe patient was admitted for management with a primary diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure and hypercalcemia.\nAfter admission, the patient's vital signs were normal, with no fever or disturbances in pulse and respiratory rates. Electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment showed regular sinus rhythm, with no abnormalities. Chest X-ray revealed minimal bilateral basal pleural effusion. Abdominal ultrasound showed slightly enlarged liver, distended gall-bladder, dilated common bile duct (0.9 cm) with no evidence of calculi, as well as minimally enlarged spleen. The pancreas was surrounded by a minimal amount of fluid.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a swollen pancreas without any focal lesions or calcification. Management included aggressive fluid therapy, furosemide, proton pump inhibitors and symptomatic treatment. Due to pain severity, several injections of pethidine were required every day. Daily lab studies were taken for 10 days, after which the patient was discharged. The fluctuations of various laboratory measurements are shown in Figure .",1.73,85.0,28.4
47378,"A 53-year-old male patient, 178 cm, 100 kg, presented with jaundice and bile ducts dilatation detected at ultrasound (US) examination.\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and magnetic resonance cholangiography revealed a type IIIa Klatskin tumor, closely adherent to portal vein bifurcation and infiltrating the proximal left portal vein. The stenosis was hemodynamically significant at US-Doppler examination ().\nIn order to resolve jaundice, the patient underwent left percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with concurrent endoluminal biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, and external biliary drainage on the right side.\nThe tumor was technically resectable by a right trisectionectomy with segment 1 and portal vein resection at this stage. However, FLR volume, as evaluated by CECT, was 395 cc, representing 14.9% of total liver volume (TLV) and 19.8% of standardized TLV (sTLV) [], thus precluding upfront resection.\nGiven the important narrowing of the proximal left portal vein, which would have jeopardized any attempt at inducing FLR hypertrophy, the patient first underwent surgical left portal vein recanalization. This was achieved by interrupting main and left portal vein outside the infiltrated area (which was deliberately not touched) and interposing an autologous internal jugular vein graft; portal bifurcation was by-passed, and portal flow was completely diverted to the left hemi-liver ().\nUnfortunately, CECT performed 3 weeks after the operation showed no increase in FLR volume, with partial reperfusion of multiple small intrahepatic right portal branches, characterized by reversed flow. Considering the technical difficulty of portal vein embolization (PVE) in this setting, percutaneous embolization of the right and middle hepatic veins (HVE) was considered as a salvage strategy ().\nUnder local anesthesia and conscious sedation, the right and middle hepatic veins (HVs) were accessed under ultrasonographic guidance with 21G Chiba needles, 0.018″ guidewires and micropuncture sets (Meditalia Biomedica, Medolla, Italy) ().\nTwo 0.035″ guidewires (Amplatz Super Stiff, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) were advanced to the atrio-caval junction and, after accommodation of two 8F × 24 cm sheaths (Radifocus Introducer II, Terumo, Japan), 6 and 7 mmHg of endoluminal pressure were measured, respectively, in the right and middle HVs. After that, both HV were occluded with Amplatzer Vascular Plugs II (St-Jude Medical, Plymouth, MN), respectively, 22 and 16 mm in diameter (90% oversized), with the distal part deployed 10–15 mm proximal to the junction with the inferior vena cava to enable further surgical ligation (). The embolization of the HVs and potential collaterals was distally completed with a 2:1 mixture of Lipiodol Ultrafluid (Guerbet, Villepinte, France) and Glubran 2 (GEM Italy, Viareggio, Italy) ().\nThe CECT scan performed 9 days after the HVE showed a 26.8% increase in volume of the FLR (501 vs. 395 cc), resulting in a kinetic growth rate (KGR) of 11.8 cc/day. FRL/TLV ratio was 20.4% (+5.5%) and the FRL/sTLV ratio was 25.1% (+ 5.3%) ().\nTwo weeks after HVE, patient underwent right hepatic trisectionectomy with caudatectomy and extra-hepatic bile ducts resection. During operation, temporary hepatic pedicle clamping during parenchymal transection was complicated by common hepatic artery thrombosis, which was managed by anastomosing the left hepatic artery to the sectioned stump of an aberrant right hepatic artery. Complete resection was confirmed by pathology report, revealing clear resection margins around a poorly differentiated bile duct adenocarcinoma with extensive venous/perihepatic fat and focal parenchymal infiltration, and micrometastasis in one hilar lymph node (pT4N1). Patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 15th ().\nAt 6-month follow-up, he is disease free and currently being administered adjuvant chemotherapy ().",1.78,100.0,31.56
153940,"A 52-year-old, 65 kg, 162 cm tall male patient was admitted for hepatoma. The patient was diagnosed as having hypertension and symptomatic ventricular premature complex and he was treated with a β-blocker and an angiotensin receptor blocker. The patient had been diagnosed with chronic renal failure two years previously and he had undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma two months before the present admission. A preoperative blood test showed no hyperkalemia: the Na+ level was 44 mM/L, the K+ level was 4.6 mM/L, the BUN level was 29.8 mg/dl and the creatinine level was 10.4 mg/dl. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.\nAnesthesia was induced with 100 mg of propofol and 50 mg of rocuronium, and then 1.5-2 vol% sevoflurane was used for anesthetic maintenance. Remifentanil at 0.4-1 µg/kg/min was continuously infused intravenously. To measure the continuous arterial pressure, a 20 gauge catheter was inserted into the right radial artery, and a 7 Fr catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein for measuring the central venous pressure. After the surgery began, the arterial blood gas analysis and the level of electrolytes were checked every two hours. The results of the arterial blood gas analysis performed at the beginning of surgery showed no hyperkalemia ().\nNeither a specific inotropic drug nor a vasoconstrictor was needed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 150-90 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 86-51 mmHg until the fourth hour of surgery. Thereafter, phenylephrine at 1-1.5 µg/kg/min was continuously infused to maintain a mean blood pressure above 60 mmHg. At the fifth hour of surgery, arterial blood gas analysis showed a K+ level of 4.89 mM, which was in the upper normal range, so additional treatment was not performed (). In surgical field, portal triad clampings were done before resecting each segment in order to confirm the resection margin. At 6.5 hours of surgery, a sudden decrease in arterial blood pressure was observed. The curvature of the radial artery diminished and the arterial blood pressure was 80/60 mmHg. At that time, trisegmentectomy had been completed, so the surgeon had begun suturing the muscle layer. No compression of the artery or vein was observed and the central venous pressure was 10 mmHg, which indicated there was no hypovolemic status. The phenylephrine infusion was increased to 2 µg/kg/min. QRS widening without a switching tall T wave was observed in the ECG, so an immediate arterial gas analysis was performed. No acidosis was observed, but the K+ level was 6.44 mM. Since hemolysis of the blood sample was possible, an arterial gas analysis was conducted again after ten minutes, and the result showed that K+ level had increased to 6.65 mM (). Calcium chloride (600 mg) was infused for several minutes and magnesium sulfate (2 mg) replacement was started for correcting the magnesium deficiency. As additional treatment was about to begin, a sudden onset of ventricular tachycardia was noted on the ECG.\nThe surgeon began chest compression and defibrillation at 200 J was performed twice. The cardiac arrest was thought to be due to hyperkalemia; therefore twenty units of insulin and 100 ml of 50% dextrose solution were mixed and infused continuously while 120 mg of sodium bicarbonate was being injected as well. One mg of epinephrine was administered repeatedly before performing defibrillation using 360 J. At 35 minutes after the initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a sinus rhythm on ECG and a systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg were observed for five minutes and the total administered epinephrine was 41 mg. Nevertheless, the ventricular fibrillation continued. Due to the lack of a response to 100 mg injected lidocaine, an amiodarone infusion was started. After applying percutaneous extracorporeal support using the right femoral vein, the ECG and blood pressure appeared to stabilize, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Over 10 hours and 50 minutes of surgery, two units of packed red blood cells and 6,680 ml of crystalloid solution were administered. The total amount of urine was 710 ml, and 1,200 ml of blood was lost during the surgery.\nTests conducted one hour after resuscitation showed signs of liver damage with the laboratory results of AST/ALT: 255/156 IU/L, Na+: 152.5 mM and K+: 3.13 mM (). The bedside transthoracic echocardiography performed in the intensive care unit showed an inadequate volume in the ventricular chamber. The patient suffered multi-organ failure under anuria conditions, and the unstable vital signs continued despite the application of percutaneous extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support. Eight hours after his arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient suffered another cardiac arrest. After the administration of atropine and epinephrine, the sinus rhythm returned briefly, but the pulse rate dropped to lower than 40/min. When the ECG continued to be flat, the resuscitation attempts were discontinued.",1.62,65.0,24.77
131408,"A 48-year-old female, public administration employee, thin physical build and non-smoker with no history of metabolic diseases or use of corticosteroids, having born two children, complained of 4-week left groin pain. At the beginning, it was dull and not radiated, of low intensity, and presented only during running activity. She denied any history of symptoms of the right hip. There was no habitual dietary abnormality that could include osteoporosis. She had started running regularly for 30 minutes, training 2 times per week just 3 months before the appearance of symptoms. Despite them, she decided to continue her physical activity with a worsening of pain and with a limp. She started a cycle of physical therapy with a further worsening of pain that started to radiate into the posterior aspect of the left lower limb.\nAfter 10 days of increasing symptoms, she came to the outpatient department of our institution. Clinically, her left hip ROM was limited by pain: flexion 80°, extension 20°, external rotation 30°, internal rotation 10°, flexion-abduction 35° and adduction 20°. The neurovascular examination showed normal results of both lower extremities. At the time of presentation, her height was 170 cm and weight 56 kg with a BMI of 19.3 Kg/m2. As for metabolic investigations, the patient presented a low blood value of vitamin D and a high level of PTH (), while all other urinary and blood tests and tumor markers were in normal range. Thus 60.000 U.I./month of Cholecalcipherol were suggested. She then underwent radiographic evaluation including x-rays and a CT scan of the pelvis and hip () which revealed a complete and displaced left femoral neck base stress fracture, Type III, according to Fuellerton and Snowdy. As the diagnosis had already been determined by radiography MRI was not necessary. Hence, surgical internal fixation by a DHS® DePuy-Synthes plate and a 7 mm-cannulated screw was proposed and performed ().\nAfter discharge, the patient was advised to use crutches, avoiding load on the left lower limb for 30 days; thereafter, assisted loading with crutches was authorized for another 20 days and complete load after that. She was assessed by the same clinical, metabolic and radiographic post-operative protocol. At 3-month follow-up, she was able to walk without crutches; she was completely pain free and had started stationary cycling and swimming. At 6-month follow-up, the blood level of cholecalcipherol was in normal range, while those of PTH persisted high (). At 12-month follow-up, the x-rays showed signs of FNSF consolidation without AVN ().",1.7,56.0,19.38

131465,"A 25-year-old Korean female patient was admitted to an acute psychiatric ward in April 2016 due to psychotic symptoms. A detailed mental status examination showed persecutory delusion, delusion of reference and auditory hallucination which occurred 6 weeks before admission. History revealed that she became pre-occupied with her body image from time to time. Thus, she has been taking diet pills and have presented with psychotic symptoms multiple times in the past. She first started taking diet pills in April 2011 from a medical clinic nearby. The medications included Furimin tablet® (phentermine 37.5 mg; Alvogen Korea, Seoul, Korea), L-Carina tablet® (330 mg; Alvogen Korea), Aeiol tablet® (alginic acid 200 mg, carboxymethyl-cellulose 100 mg; Pharvis Korea, Seoul, Korea), Therrmofen-S tablet® (acetaminophen 200 mg, caffeine 40 mg, ephedrine 15 mg; Alvogen Korea). She first took these medications irregularly and often developed idea of reference. She often avoided social interaction, such as refusing to participate in a group project at her college classes, but these symptoms did not cause significant problems.\nShe started to overdose phentermine (112.5–150.0 mg/day) from November 2012, which was immediately after she broke up with her boyfriend. Three to four weeks later, she displayed psychotic symptoms including persecutory delusion and delusion of reference, so she was not able to attend school and had to take a year of sick leave from her college. She was recommended to take anti-psychotics by a psychiatrist in a primary neuropsychiatric clinic, but she refused to do so. Thereafter, she stopped taking phentermine, and her psychotic symptoms subsided 3 weeks after phentermine cessation.\nAfter returning to her school in February 2014, she became pre-occupied with her body image once again. As a result, she started re-taking phentermine irregularly and showed idea of reference from time to time. Her use of phentermine became regular from early 2015 which progressed to taking four times its recommended dosage of 150 mg/day from 2 months before admission. Shortly after, she started to feel that her coworkers were constantly watching her and trying to physically abuse her. She also started having auditory hallucinations; voices of her parents criticizing her about taking phentermine. She also became violent and threat to her own safety. Thus, she was hospitalized to our psychiatric ward by her legal guardian.\nOn admission, her affect was slightly tense, and she complained of delusion of reference, persecutory delusion, and inappropriate guilt. Her BMI was 23 kg/m2 (height, 163 cm; weight, 61 kg), and she was preoccupied with her body weight. Initial Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score was 95. She had no previous neuropsychiatric history, history of physical illness, and family history of psychiatric illness. She did not have any suicidal ideation or attempt. Results of routine laboratory tests were normal. She was tested positive only for ephedrine on the urine drug screening.\nWe diagnosed her with substance-induced psychotic disorder because she never experienced psychotic symptoms before she took the diet pills. Among diet pills she had taken, ephedrine and caffeine may also induce psychosis. However, very few cases report ephedrine or caffeine induced psychosis episodes. In addition, the dosage of ephedrine and caffeine that she took was very low to induced psychosis., In contrast, it is well known that overdose or continuous use of phentermine can cause psychotic symptoms. Therefore, we concluded that phentermine was the most likely cause of her psychotic symptoms.\nWe prescribed her antipsychotic because her psychotic symptoms persisted although she had stopped taking the diet pills from 3 days before admission. We chose aripiprazole because it has less risk of causing weight gain., Additionally, we prescribed her lorazepam and benztropine. We increased aripiprazole to 15 mg on the 4th day of admission. After the 8th day of admission, her delusion subsided substantially, and she interacted appropriately within the psychiatric ward. Moreover, she started having insight about her symptoms and realized the risk of overdosing phentermine. Her symptoms improved gradually, and she was discharged on the 28th day of admission. On discharge, her PANSS score was dramatically improved to 20. She has been following up at our outpatient clinic without relapse of any psychotic symptom.",1.63,61.0,22.96
15458,"A 73-year-old man (weight 73 kg, height 170 cm) with a history of hypertension was scheduled for aortic valve replacement (AVR) because of severe aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient was taken to the operating room and anesthetized with midazolam, remifentanil, and sevoflurane. After tracheal intubation, a TEE probe, X7-2t Live 3D TEE xMATRIX array transducer (Philips Ultrasound, Inc., Austin, TX) was inserted into the esophagus. An initial intraoperative TEE revealed severe AR. Spectral Doppler imaging revealed holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta. In the midesophageal (ME) aortic valve (AV) long-axis (LAX), the aortic root diameter, sinus of Valsalva diameter, and diameter of the sinotubular junction were measured as being 3.0 cm, 4.0 cm, and 2.7 cm, respectively, and the vena contracta of eccentric AR was 5.3 mm with color flow Doppler (CFD). Moreover, TEE showed slightly reduced left ventricular motion (ejection fraction 39% in the modified Simpson method), trivial mitral regurgitation, and trivial tricuspid regurgitation. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was confirmed using contrast TEE and CFD before CPB.\nAVR was performed in the supra-annular position with a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Perimount Magna Ease aortic valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) using the non-everting mattress suture technique with pledgets; the PFO was closed directly. The patient was weaned from CPB on low-dose dopamine and dobutamine. TEE confirmed a well-seated AV prosthesis with good mobility of the biological valve in the ME AV LAX and ME AV short-axis (SAX) views. However, CFD revealed perpendicular and turbulent flow from the sewing ring near the stent post to the opposite side in the ME LAX view (Fig. , Additional file 1: Video Clip S1). The color flow jet ran perpendicularly from above the sewing ring though between the stent post and the sewing ring, as characteristic of non-central non-PVLs []. However, in the ME AV SAX view, a considerable flow convergence was seen adjacent to the stent post and originated from outside the sewing ring (Fig. ). The range of flow convergence seemed to be too large to be caused by TVL alone originating between the stent post and sewing ring. Further examination with CFD revealed that a turbulent flow from the outside of the sewing ring ran through perpendicularly below it and towards the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) on the opposite side (Fig. , Additional file 2: Video Clip S2), which was different from the turbulent jet shown in Fig. . These TEE findings suggested that both PVL and TVL existed in close proximity to each other (Fig. ). We were convinced that one of the turbulent jets was PVL; therefore, CPB was reinstituted to inspect the prosthesis directly.\nAn aortic cross-clamp was placed and antegrade cardioplegia was administered into the aortic root to arrest the heart. We monitored the left ventricle with TEE to avoid additional distension because of AR whilst cardioplegia was administered. Inspection of the prosthesis itself indicated that the leaflets, stent post, and sewing ring appeared to be normal within the annulus; however, there was a region adjacent to the anterior stent post near the right coronary ostium where the tip of the curved Pean forceps entered between the sewing ring and the native annulus. The region was consistent with the TEE findings and may have contributed to the observed leakage. The prosthesis was removed by cutting the surgical sutures without dropping the pledgets to the left ventricle, and it was confirmed to be uninjured. Simultaneously, the annulus and pledgets sutured to the annulus were checked. AVR was performed with the same prosthesis again in the supra-annular position using the non-everting mattress suture technique with pledgets, similar to the first AVR. It was verified that there was no loose region between the annulus and the sewing ring before the ascending aorta was closed. After weaning from CPB, TEE was performed immediately, which revealed that the unusual perpendicular turbulent flow had disappeared and only a few small TVLs were observed.\nSubsequently, the patient’s course was uneventful, and he was discharged from our hospital after approximately 2 weeks. Postoperative follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed only mild TVL with no evidence of PVL. The patient gave written consent for publication of clinical reports and echo images.",1.7,73.0,25.26
144093,"A 26-year-old female, 160 cm tall and weighed 47 kg presented to the Outpatient Division, Department of Periodontics, with the chief complaint of increased spacing between upper and lower anterior teeth since the last 2 years []. Occasionally, bleeding occurred while brushing teeth and hypersensitivity in lower anterior teeth with cold fluids. The patient's medical history revealed that she had a cleft on the right side of upper lip on at the time of birth. This cleft was a minor form of Tessier no. 1 cleft which is a paramedian, craniofacial cleft that traverses through the soft tissues from the Cupid's bow region to the alar cartilage, resulting in a notch in the dome of the nostril. She was operated at the age of 2 and 24 years [] for surgical correction of CL. She was born as the first of two children of nonconsanguineous parents after uncomplicated 37 weeks of gestation. Intelligence and other developmental milestones were normal. There was no history of absent or decreased sweating. Past dental history revealed she had congenitally missing teeth in upper and lower jaw. She had undergone root canal treatment with the lower right first premolar 5 years back. She had not taken any medication in past 1-year and has no known allergies. She gave a family history of her mother losing all her teeth at an early age due to mobility of teeth. Her 24-year-old younger brother also had a history of periodontal disease and treated with periodontal flap surgery, but her father was normal. It was observed that there was familial history for periodontal disease. She had nasal twang in her voice, long nails without any gross digital anomaly, sparse eyebrows, mild hypertelorism, potentially incompetent lips and a scar mark on right upper lip area [Figures and ].\nFederation Dentaire Internationale tooth notations were used during the oral examination. On oral examination, the status of oral hygiene was fair. Oral examination does not reveal any soft tissue defect on labial mucosa, palate, and gingiva []. Patient had 29 teeth of which 23, 31 and 41 were congenitally missing []. Probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss measurements were performed on each tooth using a graduated William's periodontal probe. Greater probing pocket depth (>6 mm) and clinical attachment loss (>3 mm) measurements were noticed with respect to teeth no. 17, 16, 13, 12, 11, 21, 22, 26, 27, 34, 36, 37, 44, 46 and 47.

Increased anterior overjet and spacing were present. The patient had Class I molar relation on both sides.\nFollowing investigations were carried out:\nPanoramic radiograph which revealed angular pattern of bone loss around 16, 12, 11, 22, 26, 37, 34, 44 and 46. Typical “arc shaped” loss of alveolar bone around maxillary molars and incisors was observed [] Blood investigations which were found to be within the normal ranges except for borderline neutrophilia [] Neutrophil function test which revealed hyperactivity in nitroblue tetrazolium test, reduced chemotaxis and reduced phagocytosis with normal intracellular killing [] Subgingival plaque sample was collected from the deepest pocket followed by microbiological culturing on Dentaid medium and blood agar with hemin and vitamin K. Dentaid is a selective culture medium for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and blood agar with hemin and vitamin K is for anaerobic micro-organisms. Minute black colonies (3 × 104 CFU/mL) of Porphyromonas gingivalis were observed [].\nBased on the family history, oral examination, radiographic details, microbiological culturing, and immunological parameters (neutrophil function test) a diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made.\nThe overall treatment was aimed at correction of increased spacing between upper and lower teeth and maintenance of oral health. It included multi-disciplinary approaches such as periodontal treatment, restorative treatment for the replacement of fixed dental prosthesis, and fixed mechano-therapy along with the opinion of plastic surgeon, endodontist and oral and maxillofacial surgeon for long-term maintenance of oral health. Periodontal treatment for aggressive periodontitis was aimed at eliminating or reducing the pathogenic micro-organisms and prevention of further bone loss. It included mechanical treatment (scaling and root planning) along with systemic antimicrobial therapy followed by periodontal flap surgery and supportive periodontal treatment at regular intervals.[]",1.6,47.0,18.36
91914,"A 34 year old middle eastern lady with a spontaneous conception presented at 13 weeks of gestation for a routine 1st trimester ultrasound and screening. Her booking weight was 79 kg and her height 165 cm. She was a housewife with three previous uncomplicated pregnancies delivered vaginally. She was on no medication except for iron supplement. The past medical and surgical history was unremarkable and the patient was neither a smoker nor an alcohol drinker. The family history of her partner and herself was unremarkable as well.\nOn 1st trimester ultrasound, the fetus was noted to have bilateral anterolateral neck cysts around 5 × 5 mm in size (Figures and ) suggestive of either 'non-septated cystic hygromas' which are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system characterized by fluid-filled jugular lymphatic sacs of the fetal neck [,] or, the much rarer bilateral branchial cleft cysts. No other abnormalities were noted and the nuchal translucency measured 2.3 mm. The patient was counselled for the high possibility of spontaneous regression and good fetal outcome awaiting the results of the integrated 1st trimester screening test. At 16 weeks, integrated screening gave a 1 in 2 risk for trisomy 18 and therefore fetal ultrasonograpy was repeated. The fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume were normal and the bilateral neck cysts were stable in size. No other abnormalities could be detected despite a careful sonographic assessment and an amniocentesis for fetal karyotyping was offered and accepted. PCR on the amniotic fluid revealed trisomy 18 which was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis.\nThe couple decided to opt for termination of pregnancy which was completed medically at 17+4 weeks with no complications. Pathologic examination of the fetus revealed a dysmorphic face with low-set ears, both legs fixed in extension and clenched fists. At autopsy the neck cysts could not be identified, but there had been considerable trauma to the scalp during delivery. Internally the kidneys and adrenals were of normal size and shape but there was dysplasia on microscopy. There was abnormal placental villous morphology, of a pattern consistent with aneuploidy.

Her mother’s OGTT at 22 weeks was normal and HbA1C was also in the normal range at 5.5 % 10 days after delivery (see details in Additional file : Table S1).\nThe BW of Patient 2 was 6850 g (+6.5 SD), BL was 59 cm (+4 SD), and birth OFC was 38 cm (+3 SD). She required immediately oxygen for transient neonatal respiratory distress; a cardiac ultrasound revealed HCM (IVSd 8 mm, +3.2 Z-score cardiac parameter Dubois; Fig. ). Molecular analysis of BWS was negative, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-microarray was normal.\nAt 21 months, her weight was 14.5 kg (+3 SD), her length was 87 cm (+2 SD), and her OFC was 48 cm (+1 SD; Fig. ). Her psychomotor development was normal and a cardiac ultrasound showed mild HCM.",1.76,80.0,25.83
72729,"A 15-year-old boy was diagnosed with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV, knee flexion contracture, equinus foot, and paralysis of right upper extremity with adduction contracture. His height was 160.0 cm and his weight was 50.2 kg. He underwent tendon fractional release of the bilateral tendons of the semitendinosus muscle, semimembranosus muscle, and biceps femoris muscle. Achilles tendon lengthening was performed on the right equinus foot using Vulpius elongation. His lower limbs were fixed with above knee plaster splints in the knee extended position and intermediate ankle position 2 weeks after surgery, and he subsequently used short leg braces. Preoperative passive range of joint motion values were as follows: right knee 35–130/left knee 20–130, ankle dorsiflexion with knee extension (DKE) 15/15, and ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexion (DKF) 35/35. At 6 postoperative months, range of joint motion was right knee 15–130/left knee 10–130, DKE 15/10, and DKF 25/20. Knee extension range and DKF improved postoperatively. Preoperative manual muscle testing showed the following: knee extension 3/3, knee flexion 4/4, ankle dorsiflexion 1/1, and ankle plantar flexion 1/1. Before surgery, he had begun crawling in the house. Before HAL intervention, he could not move with crawling because of postoperative muscle weakness. It was thought that muscle weakness was due to disuse muscle atrophy after surgery.\nHybrid Assistive Limb intervention was administered twice during postoperative months 10 and 11 in an outpatient department. Normal outpatient physical therapy was carried out in combination. The patient used the HAL for clinical study type S size (target 145–165 cm). A walking device (All-in-One Walking Trainer; Healthcare Lifting Specialist, Denmark) with a harness was used for safety, and the HAL intervention consisted of walking with the assistance of two physical therapists (Additional files and ). The HAL intervention session lasted 60 min, including rests (10 min) and time for attachment/detachment (20 min). The HAL suit has a hybrid control system comprising the CVC and CAC. The CVC mode of the HAL suit can support the patient’s voluntary motion by providing assistive torque to each joint according to voluntary muscle activity. This study used the CVC mode, which allows the operator to adjust the degree of physical support to the patient’s comfort and gradually reduce support as training progresses. Functional ambulation was assessed with the 10 m-walk test without wearing HAL and video analysis preoperatively and pre- and post- each HAL intervention (Additional files and ). We analyzed one gait cycle of the patient with Dartfish. Walking speed, stride, and cadence in the 10 m-walk test were analyzed. We took a walking video from the sagittal plane and analyzed the video in slow motion, pausing the image to measure the joint angle using the Dartfish Team Pro ver5.5. The angle of the hip, knee, ankle, and trunk in walking and in the gait cycle was analyzed using video. Video images were played back frame by frame, and the phase at the beginning of each gait cycle was confirmed. One gait cycle is defined as the movement starting from initial contact on one side till the next initial contact on the same side. The beginning of the loading response phase is defined as the initial contact, the beginning of mid stance is defined as opposite side toe off, the beginning of terminal stance is defined as heel off, the beginning of pre swing is defined as opposite side initial contact, the beginning of initial swing is defined as toe off, the beginning of the mid swing is defined as intersection of the feet, and the beginning of the terminal stance is defined as the vertical lower leg.\nIn the 10 m-walk test, the patient used ankle foot orthosis preoperatively, and did not use orthosis pre- and post-HAL intervention. He used the walker as a walking aid.\nTable shows the results of the 10 m-walk test. Speed, stride, and cadence for walking were almost the same preoperatively and pre-HAL intervention. Post-first HAL intervention, speed, stride, and cadence were increased compared to pre-HAL intervention. This was maintained until the next HAL intervention and further improved after the second HAL intervention. HAL intervention increased walking speed from 21.7 to 32.1 m/min, stride from 0.40 to 0.47 m, and cadence from 54.23 to 68.9 steps/min.\nAnkle angle during walking showed little change because he wore a short leg brace while walking preoperatively. Pre-HAL intervention, the dorsiflexion angle was large in the terminal stance and pre-swing, the plantar flexion angle was large in the initial swing, and there was a large difference between the right and left ankle angle (Fig. a, b). Post-HAL intervention, range of movement of the ankle joint became more narrow, left-right symmetry increased (Fig. a, b), and extension angles of the knee in the stance phase increased (Fig. c, d). Excessive dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the ankle joint disappeared due to extension of the angle of the knee (Fig. a, b). His extension angle of the hip did not increase and the trunk was leaning forward (Fig. e, f). Flexion of the upper limbs was strong due to spastic diplegia; therefore, he walked with the head bent forward. Because of the anteversion position, his hip joint did not show extension in walking (Fig. g). Although the horizontal plane and the hip joint were examined, extension of the hip angle in the pre-swing phase was increased (Fig. h, i). In the gait cycle, asymmetry between the left and right was prominent preoperatively (Fig. ). Comparing pre- and post-HAL, the proportion of terminal stance in the stance phase and swing phase was increased. Since the length of stride was expanded due to increased extension angles of the knee and hip, the ratio of terminal stance and terminal swing increased (Fig. ).\nAfter HAL intervention, he was able to crawl and gained the ability to move within his house, similar to his status before operation. There was no adverse event such as fall or fractures during the HAL intervention. The patient was able to walk easily while wearing HAL, and he actively participated in HAL intervention.",1.65,50.2,18.44
79863,"The second case (GS0155) is a 27-year-old female. She had had some episodes of right hemiparesis and a bowel volvulus in pediatric age. She was studied in the Neurology Unit after an episode of right hemiparesis, paresthesia and a visual field deficit. Imaging studies did not show any significant alteration. Biochemical analysis showed calcium values in the lower limit of normality (8.5–9.3mg/dl) and elevated PTH (200–300pg/ml), so she was diagnosed of pseudohypoparathyroidism. She did not present any symptom of Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy (height 1.65m; weight 68.5kg; BMI: 25.1). No other hormone deficit was detected (TSH, 3μU/ml). She referred regular periods. Calcium and vitamin D supplements (both cholecalciferol and calcifediol) were prescribed, although she is not properly following the treatment.\nIn the last visit, she referred paresthesia in upper extremities with no calcium supplementation for a month. She brought a report with analytical levels: Ca, 8.7mg/dl; P, 3.9mg/dl; Mg, 2.4mg/dl, TSH, 4.15μU/ml; PTH, 349pg/dl; 25(OH)D, 37.2 ng/ml; urine Ca, 76mg/day; CLcr, 177ml/min; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a lumbar T score of -0.7 SD and a femoral T score of -0.3 SD.

107762,"A 23-year-old male (weight 105 kg, height 175 cm, BMI, 34.3 kg/m2) was scheduled to receive eye surgery. The patient had a K-score of five. The MO was three fingers wide. Jaw protrusion was poor. Airway management is expected to be difficult due to obesity. Mask ventilation was performed smoothly. The patient's Cormack-Lehane grade was 1, and his IDS score was 2. The intubation duration was 95 s. I was not familiar with the feeling of handling VL, and the blade was initially inserted laterally. The image on the screen showed the lateral wall of the oral mucosa instead of the expected glottis structure, which confused me. After adjusting the direction of the blade, the proper structure was visualized. However, as I proceeded to intubate the patient with my right hand, my left hand was not stable enough to maintain a clear view of the glottis. This incoordination resulted in the disappearance of the glottis from the screen, leading to a risk of esophageal intubation.",1.75,34.3,11.2
12204,"A 37 year old female patient, a psychiatric nurse, was recommended at 19 years to the outpatient facility specializing in eating disorders (ED). Her anorexia nervosa symptoms appeared at 13 years, and were diagnosed at her first hospitalization after a collapse with seizures (glycemia 2.5) when she achieved her least weight (37 kg/173 cm, BMI 12.36). She has a history of long-term repeated vomiting, diets, meat rejection, vegetarianism, abuse of laxatives, drinking of some bleach, and excessive exercise. Always skeptical about the treatment, she expressed the feeling she can live with the disease because without it she would lose her self-image. During the years of illness, she experienced various psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (venlafaxin, hypnogen, seropram, prothazin, rivotril, prothiaden, fevarin), and had been hospitalized as an inpatient at the day care of a specialized ED center. When she reached 60 kg/173 cm (BMI 20.05), she felt ""fat as a pig"", and focused only on weight loss and gradually increasing somatic difficulties. Since 2016, the patient was treated for dyspepsia and malnutrition. Dysmicrobia with dyspeptic syndrome, mycotic upper esophagitis, hooked stomach, stomach evacuation disorder, and duodenogastric reflux were indicated. At that time, galactosemia and SIBO were diagnosed by an immunohistochemical examination of jejujan mucosa samples and jejunal fluid aspirate cultivation. SIBO was manifested by a wide range of symptoms: Bloating, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and abdominal cramps. Despite various antibiotic treatment regimes, and a low saccharide diet, only mild and temporary symptom alleviation was achieved. Due to the persistent symptomatology which limited the patient in daily activities, and considering the negative impact of the SIBO symptomatology, as well as the negative impact of the low saccharide diet on AN, the FMT was applied (approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital for severe gastrointestinal disorders). There were no known contraindications for this procedure. During the study, the authors monitored her psychiatric symptoms, family dynamics, and specific symptoms with eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDEQ).",1.73,37.0,12.36
127005,"A 47-year-old female with hypertension and DD diagnosed in 2014 presented to Ochsner\nMedical Center Clinic for recommendations on therapeutic options to treat her\nchronic pain.\nHer symptoms began in 2011 with weight gain and tender lipoma formation in her upper\nand lower extremities. Back then, she had achy, whole-body pains which lasted days.\nShe felt that back then her flares were monthly. She had a history of steady weight\ngain from 180 pounds in 2006 to 217 pounds in 2011. Additionally, in 2011 she had an\nexcisional biopsy of an 8x10 millimeter mass in her left upper arm and was diagnosed\nwith benign lipoma. That year, she also had an ultrasound of her left and right\nupper arms demonstrating many well circumscribed hyperechoic nodules bilaterally,\nwith the largest measuring 1cm in diameter. The final reading was consistent with\nmultiple fat necrosis. Additionally, this patient had been offered to enter a trial\nevaluating thermogenic agents in DD but ultimately declined.\nAt this visit, she presented with complaints of intermittent pains involving her\nwhole body, and numerous small, tender lipomas in her upper and lower extremities.\nHer pains were achy and dull, with 10/10 severity, beginning spontaneously and\nevolving within a few hours and lasting several days. She experienced these pains\ntwice this year and had intermittent episodes for eight years. She found that hot\nwater immersion of her limbs and herbal detox regimens improved her pain. Her pain\nwas worsened by consumption of sugary or fatty foods, exercise, and stress. These\nflares were associated with mild confusion, impaired memory, weakness, fatigue, and\nnight sweats. She felt that flares were triggered by unhealthy eating, weight gain,\nand exercising, and she had undergone extensive lifestyle modification to eliminate\nthese factors. In addition, flares typically began 3-4 days before her menstrual\ncycle started. When flares were not related to her cycle, she felt she could predict\ntheir onset a day prior. She tried meloxicam 3.75 mg, which had improved her pain.\nShe had previously been treated with prednisone 20 mg for one day, followed by 10 mg\nper day for 2 days. She was also prescribed additional prednisone for use as needed,\nbut she felt that it did not help with her flares. Her last intramuscular injection\nof steroids was 1 year ago, and her last dose of oral prednisone was 3 years ago.\nShe had since refused steroids. She tried ibuprofen 800 mg and gabapentin 100 mg,\nwhich did not help. She never used lidocaine, methotrexate, infliximab, or\ninterferon.\nReview of symptoms was significant for low grade temperatures to 99 degrees and night\nsweats twice a week, with the need to change her nightgown. She had chronic fatigue\nand body aches. She had dyspnea on exertion, easy skin bruising, and chronic dry\nmouth. She denied any joint stiffness or swelling.\nMedical history was significant for hypertension on losartan 50 mg. She had chronic\ndry mouth, depression, and fibroids. She had a miscarriage in 1993 at 3 months\ngestation, complicated by retained fetal contents. Surgical history was significant\nfor a hernia repair, cesarean section, and appendectomy. Family history was\nsignificant for a father with severe obesity. Her father weighed more than 400\npounds but was thin before his 30s. Per the patient, her father had similar pain\nflares. He had early and severe osteoarthritis. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis\nand was undergoing treatment. Her maternal grandmother had similar arthralgias to\nher mother but was never diagnosed with a medical condition. The patient never\nsmoked, did not drink, and did not engage in non-prescription drug use. She was\nemployed in a stressful occupation in social work in the mental health setting.\nThis patient’s blood pressure at this visit was 145/88. She had fluctuating\nhypertension with blood pressures between 168/91 and 117/76. Pulse rate was 76.\nHeight was 5’3”, with weight at 219 pounds, and BMI of 38.74. Physical examination\nshowed a well-appearing obese woman who had some difficulty with remote memory.\nCardiopulmonary examination was normal. Musculoskeletal exam revealed multiple\nsub-centimeter lipomas palpable which were very tender to light touch. These were\nnot visible on general inspection. There were 7-8 nodules on the volar surfaces of\nleft and right forearms, upper arms, and distal lower extremities. One large 2-3cm\nlipoma was present on the right forearm dorsal surface. This patient did not have\ntenderness in the shoulders, neck, and upper back.\nHer laboratory values during initial evaluation demonstrated chronic hypokalemia\nbetween 3.2 to 3.8 (normal 3.5-5.1 mmol/L). Her last inflammatory markers had an\nelevated CRP at 17 (normal 0.0-8.2 mg/L) and elevated ESR at 30 (normal 0-20 mm/hr).\nAnti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were\nnegative. Anti-SSA was not performed. CPK and TSH were normal. Vitamin D was low at\n14 (normal 30-96 ng/mL). She had chronic iron deficiency anemia secondary to heavy\nmenses and a colonoscopy without malignant findings. Follow up laboratory results\nshowed continued microcytic anemia with hemoglobin 9.4 (normal 12.0-16.0 g/dL),\nborderline low potassium at 3.5 and low vitamin D at 24. Additionally, follow up\nCRP, ESR, CPK, aldolase, TSH, and free T4 were normal.\nThis patient’s presentation remained consistent with DD, as she exhibited the\ncardinal symptoms of generalized obesity, multiple painful fatty masses, weakness\nand susceptibility to fatigue, and confusion. Cushing syndrome was considered due to\nhypokalemia, hypertension, easy skin bruising, weight gain, muscle aches, and\nfatigue. Vitamin D deficiency was considered in the differential due to fatigue and\nbody aches. At her prior visit, family history of paternal obesity and pain was not\nknown. Lipomatoses such as multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) and familial\nmultiple lipomatosis (FML) were considered less likely due to tenderness of\nsubcutaneous nodules. Fibromyalgia was considered less likely due to absence of\ntender points.\nThis patient ultimately was referred to endocrinology to evaluate for Cushing\nsyndrome. The patient was discharged with instructions to take meloxicam prior to\nflare to determine if it has abortive or suppressive effects. Clinic follow up was\nscheduled for 1 month pending evaluation of therapeutic options.",1.6,99.3,38.79
35053,"Case 1 is a 91-year-old Japanese woman who had been diagnosed with acute onset of type 1 diabetes two years earlier and had been using various doses and types of insulin since that diagnosis. Her endogenous insulin secretory capacity was almost completely lost since her post-meal (approximately two hours after a meal) C-peptide levels were undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml) and 24-hour urine C-peptide levels were below 1.1 mg/day (normal range, 20.1 to 155 mg/day). Her insulin antibodies were positive at diagnosis. Why this patient developed acute onset of autoimmune type 1 diabetes with absolute insulin deficiency is elusive.\nThis may be an atypical case. Her post-meal glucagon level was 130 pg/ml (normal range, 23 to 197 pg/ml). Her body mass index (BMI) was 21.5 (body weight/body height = 40.4 kg/137 cm). Her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was above 9.5% in the three months prior to this study. Sitagliptin (25 mg/day) was added to the ongoing therapeutic regimen to provide better control of her diabetes. At that time, she was using premixed biphasic insulin aspart (30% insulin aspart and 70% protamine-complexed insulin aspart; Novorapid 30 Mix (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) three times daily before each meal (14U, 4U and 14U, respectively). She was also taking 50 mg of miglitol three times daily and 150 mg/day aliskiren. Her post-meal blood glucose was 252 mg/dl, and her HbA1c level was 9.6% at the start of sitagliptin therapy (at baseline). She had occasionally mild hypoglycemia after starting sitagliptin, which she could manage by taking glucose drinks by herself. Her HbA1c levels were followed for 24 weeks and were reduced from 9.6% to 7.4% (2.2% reduction) (Figure ). The doses of insulin remained unchanged, but at 20 weeks, because of the relatively good glycemic control for her age, miglitol was discontinued. Because her blood pressure started to rise at around 20 weeks, 150 mg/day aliskiren was replaced with 4 mg/day candesartan. Her post-meal C-peptide levels repeatedly remained undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml) after sitagliptin treatment. No adverse events were observed in the kidney (assessed on the basis of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) or liver (assessed by glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and g-glutamyl traspeptidase function). No weight gain or gastrointestinal complaints were noted.\nBefore and during the sitagliptin treatment, no special difference in diet management or physical exercise was noted.",1.37,40.4,21.52
108442,"A 15-year-old male (height, 159 cm; weight, 43 kg) presented to the emergency department with sudden severe central chest pain radiating to the left shoulder. His blood pressure was 83/56 mmHg, pulse 84 beats/minute, and body temperature 36.1°C. His cardiovascular physical examination was unremarkable, and no evidence of connective tissue disorder and vasculitis was apparent.\nHe and his family history were unremarkable for cardiovascular disease, vasculitis, and connective tissue diseases including Marfan syndrome. He had undergone video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax 3 months before and for left pneumothorax 2 months before at the former hospital.\nThe initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, and V2 to V6 (). Laboratory investigations showed an elevated white blood cell count at 25.0 × 109/L (normal value: 3.3–8.6 × 109/L) and a normal level of C-reactive protein at 0.1 mg/L (normal value: 0.0–1.4 mg/L). Creatine kinase (CK), CKMB, and troponin I were within normal limits at 75 U/L (normal value: 59–248 U/L), 17 U/L (normal value: 0–20 U/L), 0.01 ng/mL (normal value: 0.00–0.09 ng/mL), respectively. Chest X-ray revealed a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette (). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed significant pericardial effusion of which Hounsfield unit was approximately 50 HU, suggesting that it might be high protein fluid or bloody. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with normal left ventricular size and function with an ejection fraction of 68% (Videos 1 and 2).\nBased on the clinical history and the ECG findings, our working diagnosis was pericarditis of unknown origin. The differential diagnosis included infectious pericarditis (viral or tubercular) and non-infectious pericarditis (autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases, pericardial injury syndromes, and malignancies).\nWe managed him with a conservative strategy, including treatment with ibuprofen. On the third day after admission, echocardiogram showed decreasing pericardial effusion and ECG showed improvement of ST elevation. Laboratory investigations for bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and collagen vascular diseases were negative. His course was carefully monitored because he was young and had near-fatal event. On the morning of the day 12, we confirmed that the pericardial effusion had decreased. On hospital day 13, he experienced sudden severe chest pain after vomiting, became diaphoretic, and developed cardiogenic shock. An echocardiogram revealed the pericardial effusion to have increased to > 30 mm with tamponade physiology. He underwent emergent pericardiocentesis and drainage of 300 mL of blood (haemoglobin of the fluid was 12.8 g/dL). Bacterial cultures and cytology were negative. A full body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positive emission tomography scan for detecting malignancies revealed no significant FDG uptake. Coronary angiography showed a 2 mm saccular-shaped pseudoaneurysm in the posterolateral (PL) branch of right coronary artery (RCA) (Video 3). We recognized that rupture of the coronary pseudoaneurysm caused the acute haemopericardium. Based on his past medical history, we speculated that the coronary pseudoaneurysm was caused by trauma associated with prior procedures for pneumothoraces.\nWe treated the coronary pseudoaneurysm by percutaneous management with coil embolization. The procedure was performed via the right femoral artery approach. Using Runthrough NS floppy (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) guidewire with Heartrail II JR3.5 catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), the guidewire and Excelsior SL-10 (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) microcatheter were successfully inserted to the PL branch of RCA (, ). One detachable coil; 2 mm × 8 mm Trufill DCS Orbit® (Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, MA, USA) was delivered through a microcatheter (, ). A final angiogram showed obliteration of blood flow to the pseudoaneurysm (, ).\nThe patient experienced chest pain for 1 day after the procedure, although post-procedural echocardiogram did not show any abnormality (, and ). He had no symptoms on the second post-procedural day. Post-procedural electrocrdiogram showed inverted T waves in leads III, aVF (). He was discharged 12 days after the procedure.",1.59,43.0,17.01
153943,"A 44-year-old male, weighing 79 kg with a height of 176 cm, and presenting with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, was scheduled for multi-level cervical laminectomy using the posterior approach. Aside from pulmonary tuberculosis completely treated 20 years ago, his past history was unremarkable. The patient was newly diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus after admission, and was placed on anti-hypertensive medication thereafter. A preoperative chest radiograph revealed apical thickening and volume loss in the right upper lobe, and blunting of the right cardiopulmonary angle (). Pulmonary function test did not reveal major obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, and echocardiography showed normal sized cardiac chambers and normal valvular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.\nUpon arrival at the operating theater, standard monitoring devices, including ECG lead II, pulse oximetry and oscillometric non-invasive blood pressure, were applied. Before the induction of anesthesia, glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg was given intravenously. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 0.5 µg/kg bolus, followed by 0.1 µg/kg/min infusion, and propofol 1.5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation with a 7.0 mm (I.D.) wire-reinforced tube (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland) using a light wand was facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, and the insertion depth was 23 cm at the upper incisors. When both lung fields were auscultated after intubation, only weak, high-pitched sounds were heard with high resistance felt upon manual ventilation. The ventilator, set for a tidal volume (VT) of 650 ml, was able to deliver VT of only 180-220 ml with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 45 cmH2O. Bronchospasm was suspected, so the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was raised to 6 vol%, dexamethasone 10 mg was injected intravenously, and 100% oxygen was supplied. Although the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was maintained at 98-100%, the elevated PIP did not decrease and VT was continuously reduced. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH of 7.309, PaCO2 of 55.8 mmHg and PaO2 of 470.9 mmHg, representing respiratory acidosis. A chest radiograph, taken to rule out bronchial intubation or pneumothorax, showed only the tracheal deviation to the right side and about 2 cm distance between the tip of the ETT and the carina ().\nFiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed, to rule out a thickened mucous plug. Bronchoscopy showed no mucous plugging, however, the beveled end of the wire-reinforced tube was almost completely obstructed by the mucosal wall. The proper position of the ETT could not be verified because of the tracheal deviation. Therefore, the ETT was gradually withdrawn to 21 cm at the upper incisor, and then rotated until the lumen of the ETT became patent under the fiberoptic guidance. The PIP immediately decreased to 22 cmH2O with a VT of approximately 8 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. After confirming that equal breath sounds were auscultated bilaterally, and SaO2 was maintained at 99-100% with 40% oxygen in air, the patient was turned to the prone position onto the chest rolls. During pinning of the head, the ventilator was again able to deliver a VT of only 180 ml with the PIP increased to 45 cmH2O. Additionally, bilateral breath sounds were again diminished. When the patient was returned to the supine position, the PIP immediately decreased to 22 cmH2O with an adequate VT. As the nearly complete obstruction of the beveled tip of the wire-reinforced tube was considered to be the primary cause, the wire-reinforced tube was replaced with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube with a Murphy-eye side hole (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland).\nThereafter, the patient was placed prone onto the Wilson frame, and the PIP was stably maintained with adequate ventilation. There was no apparent hypoxemia during the surgical procedures. At the end of the surgery, an ABG showed pH of 7.388, PaCO2 of 35.0 mmHg, and PaO2 of 257.9 mmHg. The patient was extubated and then transferred to the general ward. Chest computerized tomography, taken for postoperative evaluation, revealed a tracheal bronchus supplying the right upper lobe and originating from the right lateral tracheal wall 1.2 cm above the carina (). The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any pulmonary complications.",1.76,79.0,25.5
116040,"A 34-year-old female (162 cm, 42 kg) underwent kidney transplantation due to end-stage renal disease at the Gachon university Gil medical center (1600-bed tertiary referral hospital), Incheon, South Korea during year 2015. She had a history of long-term laxative ingestion due to chronic constipation. Eight months pre-transplantation, she was diagnosed with renal insufficiency with hypokalemia, but did not experience any subjective symptom. Profound hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis persisted, as determined by monthly laboratory follow-up visits, despite regular oral potassium supplementation (). Peritoneal dialysis was started six months before transplantation. The patient was determined to undergo kidney transplantation from her sister and started plasma exchange/plasma pheresis using 12 units of AB+ fresh frozen plasma due to ABO incompatibility (Donor, AB+; Recipient O+). Anti-A and -B were reduced from 1:16 and 1:4 to 1:1 and 1: 1, respectively, after four plasma exchanges. She was taking mycophenolate sodium, tacrolimus, intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroid after applying rituximab. Prior to transplantation, her mental status was alert. Preoperative electrocardiography and chest x-ray were normal, and blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature were 105/65 mmHg, 84 beats/minute, and 36.4oC, respectively. Preoperative laboratory data were as follows: hematocrit 26.6%, platelet count 267 × 103/mL, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 46.2 mg/dL, Creatinine (Cr) 6.1 mg/dL, tCO2 53.8 mEq/L, potassium (K+) 3.8 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) 74 mEq/L, Prothrombin Time (PT) 9.2 seconds and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 27.8 seconds. Parathyroid hormone was 298.6 pg/mL (normal range 10 - 65 pg/mL). Arterial blood gas analysis in the preanesthetic room revealed pH 7.56, PaO2 88 mmHg, PaCO2 71 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 60 mEq/L, and base excess 30 mEq/L. All analyzers for serum variables (TBA-200FR NEO, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) and arterial blood gas analysis (GEM Premier 3000, Instrumentation Laboratory, MA, USA) were calibrated periodically and the measuring variables were selected as preoperative evaluation protocol of our institute. The samples were analyzed for pH, PaCO2 (standard electrodes), and the base excess and HCO3- were taken from the arterial blood gas analyzer, which uses the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation and the van Slyke equation. Additionally, the concentrations of serum values, including K+, Cl- (ion-selective electrode) and tCO2, were measured using the same blood samples. Remifentanil 40 μg, lidocaine 40 mg, propofol 80 mg, and cis-atracurium 5 mg were administered for anesthetic induction. To maintain a Bispectral Index (BIS) score between 40 and 60, anesthesia was maintained with desflurane at 4 - 7 vol% and remifentanil at 0.05 - 0.1 µg/kg/minute. A 20-G right radial arterial catheter and a 16-Fr right internal jugular venous catheter were inserted. During transplantation, vital signs were maintained at blood pressure 97/55 - 130/78 mmHg, heart rate 72 - 91 beats/minute, and central venous pressure 2 - 9 mmHg without transfusion of blood components. The total amount of infused fluid was 3800 mL, estimated blood loss was 350 mL and urine output was 1110 mL, during the six-hour operation. The ABGA values during the operation are provided in . During the 70-minute post-anesthetic care unit stay, urine output was 850 mL, and vital signs were stable with alert mentality despite a PaCO2 value of 64 mmHg ().\nThe patient was discharged on postoperative day 15 without complication and remained asymptomatic at her 12-month follow-up without an electrolyte abnormality or sign of rejection.",1.62,42.0,16.0
60856,"A 14-year-old boy with no specific medical or family history was referred to our institute in order to identify the origin of his fever. 2 months before admission, he had a small amount of intermittent hematochezia (once or twice a day at most) attached to soft stools. Furthermore, he suffered from remittent fever of around 39 °C and malaise followed by diarrhea and appetite loss 3 weeks before admission. Thus, he visited his family physician and was referred to our institute for further investigation. However, he developed chronic chest pain before the outpatient follow-up (1 week before admission). Transthoracic echocardiography and thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed a pericardial effusion. Because the pericardial effusion continued to increase, he was admitted to our institute for detailed examination and treatment of the underlying disease.\nAt the time of admission, his height and weight were 170 cm (70th percentile) and 47.2 kg (20th percentile, 0.8 kg less than 2 months before admission), respectively. Body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation on room air were 37.1 °C, 116/61 mmHg, 110 beats/minute, 14 breaths/minute, and 97%, respectively. On physical examination, he had a mildly pale complexion and eyelid conjunctiva, diminished heart sounds, anterior chest pain relieved by bending forward, and mild tenderness in the lower mid-abdomen. The patient’s laboratory findings are summarized in Table . No remarkable abnormalities were found on urinalysis. An electrocardiogram showed decreased T wave amplitude in V1 to V3, which may be a finding of low potentials due to a pericardial effusion and myocarditis. On chest X-ray, the cardiothoracic ratio increased from 41.0% to 55.0% in the week before admission (Fig. a). Transthoracic echocardiography showed an echo-free space of 30 mm from the apex to the pericardium on the left ventricular axial view, indicating a pericardial effusion (Fig. b). In addition, anomalous motion of the ventricular septum was also confirmed, and the diameter of the inferior vena cava was 22 mm, with no respiratory variability. After admission, a sudden drop of blood pressure to 85/70 mmHg with tachycardia (132 beats/minute) appeared on the second day. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed to prevent hemodynamic collapse; 500 mL of bloody pericardial fluid were aspirated by the puncture (Fig. c). His blood pressure recovered rapidly to 115/65 mmHg. The heart rate also decreased to 80 beats/minute immediately after the puncture. Thus, after the procedure, he was finally diagnosed as having cardiac tamponade. The aspirated fluid was an exudative pericardial fluid, and no malignant cells were found on cytological examination. No mediastinal tumor was identified on chest contrast-enhanced MRI, but contrast delay along the pericardium was observed, which was consistent with the pericarditis (Fig. d). Whole-body gallium scintigraphy also showed no abnormal accumulation. After pericardiocentesis, the inflammatory response decreased mildly, but the hematochezia persisted. To clarify the etiology, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (CS) were performed. EGD showed no macroscopic or histological abnormalities. In contrast, CS showed multiple irregular-shaped aphthae on the contralateral side of the mesenteric attachments from the right transverse colon to the cecum (Fig. a). No abnormalities were observed on small intestinal capsule endoscopy. Mucosal biopsy at the ascending colon and cecum showed nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltration into the submucosa and some granulomatous findings with prominent neutrophilic infiltration adjacent to blood vessels (Fig. b). Head MRI showed nasal and sinus mucosal thickening and a cystic mass in the left sphenoid sinus (Additional file : Fig. S1). No abnormalities were found on renal biopsy. No genetic variants of monogenic inflammatory bowel diseases were detected on whole-exome sequencing of a peripheral blood specimen. GPA was diagnosed based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria, and the 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis [] and the Endorsed Consensus Criteria for the Classification of Childhood Vasculitides of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) [], the EULAR/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO)/PRES proposed validated classification criteria [], and the algorithm of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) [].\nAfter diagnosis, treatment with intravenous prednisolone (PSL) (40 mg/day) and azathioprine (AZA) (100 mg/day) was started on the 21st day of hospitalization, and negative fecal occult blood was confirmed on the 29th day. The patient was discharged on the 36th day, and PR3-ANCA converted to negative during outpatient treatment. However, the PR3-ANCA level increased again, the fecal occult blood test became positive, and micro occult blood and protein were found on urinalysis immediately after PSL tapering was completed. Oral PSL was resumed, and methotrexate (MTX) (12 mg/week) was started after the recurrence. Currently, he has no apparent clinical symptoms, and PR3-ANCA has remained around 3.0 IU/mL with the combination therapy of AZA and MTX.",1.7,47.2,16.33
73911,"A 37-year-old pregnant woman weighing 74 kg and 158 cm tall at 38+6 weeks of her second pregnancy was admitted with vaginal bleeding for 2 hours, Kussmaul's breathing (42/min), and history of persistent vomiting for 1 day. She had a previous history of hyperlipidemia for 2 years without any regular treatment or monitoring. She did not drink alcohol or take thiazides or B-blockers, betamethasone was not administered for fetal lung maturation, and the patient showed normal thyroid function in her second trimester examination. During this same examination, the antenatal examination indicated a slight increase in serum lipid levels (triglyceridemia: 4.92 mmol/L in her second trimester of pregnancy). On admission, the woman's body temperature, blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation were normal. She appeared dehydrated, but was still fully conscious. Urinalysis revealed glucose (−), ketones (4+), and protein (1+) while random plasma glucose was 6.3 mmol/L. Findings included severe anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) with pH 7.12 (normal range: 7.35–7.45); PCO2<10 mm Hg (normal range: 35–45 mm Hg); bicarbonate: 3 mmol/L (normal range: 21–28 mmol/L); lactate: 1.6 mmol/L (normal range: 0.7–3.0 mmol/L); and anion gap: 29.2 mmol/L (normal range: 10–18 mmol/L). Biochemical tests showed liver and kidney function were roughly normal.\nThe fetal biophysical score was 3, and fetal heart monitoring showed fetal distress; thus an emergency caesarean section was implemented 2 hours after admission. General anesthesia was performed, a 2610 g male baby was delivered with an APGAR score of 4 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes. Umbilical cord venous pH was 6.86, pCO2 was 41.4 mm Hg, pO2 was 12 mm Hg, BE was −26 mmol/L, HCO3 was 4 mmol/L, and blood glucose was 1.9 mmol/L. The mother was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a tracheal catheter for further treatment, her breathing pattern allowing pressure support ventilation. Her arterial blood gases (ABG) are listed in Table . The metabolic acidosis was treated with fluid resuscitation using compound sodium lactate and bicarbonate, but this did not correct the acidosis sufficiently. We switched this treatment to 5% dextrose, together with insulin 6U. The metabolic parameters were corrected in 24 hours, and the patient was extubated at 48 hours.\nWhen we performed the ABG, we found the patient's blood presented with chylomicronemia (Fig. ). The following values were noted: serum total triglycerides (TG) were 19.93 mmol/L (normal < 2.83 mmol/L), serum total cholesterol (TC) was 12.53 mmol/L (normal < 5.18 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 0.44 mmol/L (normal >1.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 1.35 mmol/L (normal < 3.3 mmol/L), apolipoprotein A was 11.17 mmol/L (normal range: 0.76–2.14 mmol/L), and apolipoprotein B was 1.23 mmol/L (normal range: 0.46–1.42 mmol/L). We closely monitored the serum levels of amylase (AMY) and lipase (LIP) in case of acute pancreatitis (AP) (Fig. ). An ultrasound of the abdomen was reported normal. As the hypertriglyceridemia did not induce AP, the patient chose to accept fenofibrate but not plasmapheresis to reduce the level of blood lipids. Four days later the levels of serum triglycerides declined to 11.31 mmol/L, and serum cholesterol declined to 9.86 mmol/L. At last, both the mother and baby were healthily and subsequently discharged.",1.58,74.0,29.64
77709,"We report the case of a 46-y.o. Italian Caucasian man (1.70 m, 70 kg), working as a full-time legal consultant.\nHe was brought to the emergency room of our Psychiatric Department in 2013, after having ingested a large quantity of zolpidem, a prescription drug indicated for insomnia, with suicidal intent. His family history was negative for psychiatric disorders, but he presented a positive medical history for liver disease (active chronic hepatitis C and Gilbert's syndrome). He had never suffered from any psychiatric symptoms in his childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. He had no family history of psychiatric disorders.\nThe patient’s psychopathological onset occurred three months prior to admission when, after continuous use (from one to three times a week) of a non-specified recreational drug since July 2012, provided to him by a friend who used to buy it online. He developed a persecutory delusion, characterized by the conviction of being spied upon by some unknown people who placed video cameras around his house. In addition, he believed that sexual activity he had with his wife was being filmed and then spread on pornographic websites. For this reason, in the following weeks, he made a written complaint against unknown persons and presented it to the local police office. In addition, one night he called the police force to his own home, as he saw suspicious movements outside his window. On that occasion, the police found out that the patient had a gun, which was then confiscated due to security concerns. Thus, the police then became part of patient’s delusional plot: the patient started thinking his daughter was involved in prostitution and he blamed the police for that. These events, along with two formal warnings received from his employer (since he did not show up for work for many days in a row), and a prolonged condition of global insomnia, generated a state of severe discouragement and embarrassment in the patient. On account of this he attempted suicide by ingesting a large quantity of zolpidem tablets (about 40 tablets of 10 mg, as related by the patient himself). Zolpidem had been prescribed four months prior to admission by a general practitioner to treat the patient’s insomnia.\nIn the emergency room of our hospital, the patient was initially drowsy and slow in his movements, although he was eupneic and had stable vital parameters. He underwent a physical examination, an electrocardiogram, a chest X-ray and a brain computer tomography, which were all normal. Though initially considered appropriate, no gastric lavage with activated charcoal was conducted as the patient had a spontaneous episode of vomiting. The patient was rehydrated with intravenous physiological saline and then admitted to our ward.\nSince the first day of admission, during the daily interviews with the medical staff, the patient showed the same delusional ideas described above and showed a very poor insight about his psychopathological condition [Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score=50]. He admitted that the drug he had been taking during the previous months might have had a role in the development of his thoughts, but this did not change his belief that he was being persecuted by the police and his colleagues and managers at work. During his hospitalization, which lasted 17 days, his prolonged insomnia improved. He developed a mild criticism of his delusion, doubting some of the events he had reported, but contemporarily maintained a suspicious behavior towards the nurses and the doctors and an overall persecutory ideation. At discharge, he reported that he intended to sue the policeman who visited him at home as he had no right to suspend his gun license, showing overall poor insight and a very solid and structured delusion (BPRS score=31).\nAs soon as the patient was admitted to our ward, we collected blood and urine samples, which were analyzed by the central laboratory of our hospital. Haematological and chemistry tests highlighted a condition of normocytic anemia (Hb 11.2 mg/dl, Ht 33.4%, mean cell volume (MCV) red cells 3.55 × 10\n6/mmc) and a mild hepatic distress [alanine transaminase (ALT) 136 U/l]. Routine screening for psychotropic drugs gave negative results. A positive emission tomography (PET) was performed on the 10\nth day of admission, which showed some unspecific findings consisting of an increased glucose metabolism in the basal nuclei but normal levels in the cortical regions.\nDuring the hospitalization period, a sample of the drug the patient had used for some months, in the form of white powder, was found at his home and delivered to the medical staff. This powder sample, along with further blood and urine samples, were sent to the Legal Medicine laboratory in the Forensic Toxicology section of our University, after having obtained a regular written consent from the patient. A specific analysis on the three samples was conducted by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The following molecules were found by the analysis on the powder: methylenedioxypyrovalerone, mephedrone, butylone and alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (a-PVP) (the proportion of the each was not provided by the laboratory) (\n). Traces of methylenedioxypyrovalerone were found in the urine sample. A test for psychotropic drugs gave negative results for the blood sample.\nWith regards to the psychopharmacological therapy, since the beginning of his hospitalization the patient was treated with haloperidol 5 mg daily, showing an overall good medication adherence although his response was very poor. For this reason, we decided to administer an injection of haloperidol decanoate at a dosage of 150 mg (to be repeated every 4 weeks, as part of an outpatient regimen). One month after his discharge, in a follow-up visit, the patient showed a BPRS score of 29, corresponding to a slight improvement in persecutory delusion but no change in insight.",1.7,70.0,24.22
154043,"A 28-year-old male, weighing 67 kg and height 180 cm with fracture tibia was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation. Subarachnoid block was given with 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) and a sensory level of T8 was achieved. Surgery was started and patient remained hemodynamically stable. Sixty minutes later, when surgeon was performing periosteal stripping, there was sudden hypotension (blood pressure decreased from 118/78 mmHg to 78/40 mmHg) and bradycardia (heart rate decreased from 84/min to 40/min). Intravenous atropine (0.3 mg repeated twice) was administered. Patient complained of discomfort in the lower limb at the surgical site. Intravenous fentanyl (25 µg) was administered. Hemodyanamic parameters became normal. Sensory level was T8. Patient remained stable thereafter.",1.8,67.0,20.68
84951,"A 6-year-old male patient with a history of mild learning disabilities was referred to our hospital for polyuria and polydipsia and diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes, which rapidly proved to be particularly challenging in terms of metabolic control with fasting blood glucose levels ranging from 203 to 431 g/dl, despite intensive therapy with different therapeutic regimens ().\nFurther investigation of the disease excluded autoimmune causes (both Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies, ICCA, and Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies, GADA, were negative) and revealed the following HLA haplotype: HLA-A*02, *24; HLA-B*07, * 08; HLA-C*04, * 07; DRB1*03, * 13; DQB1*02, * 06.\nHis learning disabilities and general pediatric exam suggested a potential visual impairment, which prompted an evaluation by ophthalmology. At age 6, the patient presented with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/20 (3/10), bilateral optic nerve head pallor () and no other retinal abnormalities. The presence of bilateral optic atrophy associated with non-auto immune diabetes suggested a clinical diagnosis of Wolfram Syndrome (WS).\nAt age 8, nocturnal enuresis became frequent and ultrasonography suggested neurogenic bladder. A deteriorated performance at school was also noted due to problems in speaking (immature speech and difficulties in articulation and phonological processes), reading and interpreting, leading to his failing to pass to the next school year. His intelligence quotient (IQ) was evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and determined to be 64 (an IQ between 50 and 69 is considered “borderline mental functioning” in this testing conditions).\nAt age 16, the patient had incomplete pubertal development with testicular atrophy associated with increased FSH levels, normal LH and normal total testosterone levels (). His height and weight were 1.65 m (5.41 ft; percentile P 10–25) and 64.5 kg (142.2 lbs; P 50–75), respectively. Regarding his metabolic status, abdominal lipodystrophy was evident and glycemic control remained highly inadequate (HbA1c 8.8 – 9%) under treatment with a 1.5 U/kg daily dose of insulin. His insulin sensitivity factor was 20 g/dl and his insulin/carbohydrates ratio was 5G. Blood pressure was 119/63 mmHg.\nDuring the 10 years of follow-up, the patient underwent periodic multidisciplinary assessments; inadequate metabolic control was observed throughout these evaluations with HbA1c ranging from 8.6 to 9% despite multiple attempts with different therapeutic combinations and nutritional strategies.\nOphthalmological assessments revealed a progressive deterioration in BCVA [from 6/20 (3/10), at age 6, to 6/125 (1/20), at age 16] associated with continued atrophy of the optic disc () and significant functional impairment in visual field (Goldmann) and electrophysiological testing. Visual evoked potentials (VEP), an electrophysiological test that measures conductance of electrical impulse from the optic nerve to the brain, were significantly impaired showing increased latency and decreased amplitude of the P100 wave, especially in the left eye. However, no associated changes were noted in the full field ERG. These findings are suggestive of a significant and isolated defect at the level of the optic nerve.\nThe patient also underwent two audiometry exams at age 10 and 12 that were normal for all hearing frequencies. He did not develop any symptoms suggestive of diabetes insipidus or diabetic vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. His thyroid function and cortisol values were within the normal range of values ().\nGenetic analyses identified two sequence variants in homozygosity in the WFS1 gene of our patient, who is the second child of a Self-reportedly non-consanguineous couple. The presence of non-consanguinity, however, could not be accurately determined because the father and the family members from the older generation refused to undergo genetic testing.\nThe sequence variants identified were the following:\nA novel missense variant c1066T>C (pSer356Pro), in exon 8;\nA previously described variant c482G>A (pArg161Gln), in exon 5, initially associated with low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL) [] and later described in the 1000 Genomes Project [] and interpreted as benign by Shearer et al. [].\nHis mother and his 19-year-old sister were heterozygous for the same sequence variants in the WFS1 gene, while the 11-year-old brother did not present any variations (). These findings highly suggest that (1) both sequence variants must be located on the same chromosome (haplotype) and that (2) the presence of the two haplotypes in homozygosity is the cause for Wolfram syndrome in this family.",1.65,64.5,23.69
124058,"A 32-year-old, 47 kg, 162 cm, female with controlled hyperthyroidism and huge pelvic mass, presented for huge pelvic mass resection. Her regular medications include propylthiouracil (PTU) and propranolol. Her thyroid function tests showed a suppressed TSH < 0.012 mU/L (normal range, 0.35–4.94 mU/L), with free thyroxine (FT4) 0.68 ng/dL (normal range, 0.70–1.48 ng/dL), and total tri-iodothyronine (TT3) 2.19 nmol/L (normal range, 1.34–2.73 nmol/L).\nPhysical examinations showed pulse rate (PR) of 63/minute and blood pressure (BP) of 121/71 mmHg. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no abnormalities.\nThe patient was premedicated with injection luminal (0.1 g, i.m.) 30 minutes before entering operation room (OR). The monitoring including pulse oximetry, ECG, noninvasive BP, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), bispectral index (BIS) was set up after the patient's presentation in operation room. Invasive BP and nasopharyngeal temperature was achieved after intravenous access. General anesthesia was induced with dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg, sufentanyl 0.5 μg/kg, and propofol 1.5 mg/kg, and cisatracurium 1.5 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5% to 3%, remifentanil 0.1 to 0.2 μg/kg/min. During intubation, she was at a rate of 55 to 70 beats/min. After about 5 minutes, she gradually developed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125 to 140 beats/min. The value of BIS was 53∼60. So attempts to slow the sinus tachycardia with esmolol 0.5 mg/kg resulted in acute hemodynamic deterioration. Esmolol was firstly chosen because only esmolol was available to slow the HR in the operating room. After 1 minute, she had no response but gradually increased the sinus tachycardia at a rate of 165 beats/min. Esmolol 0.5 mg/kg was injected again and failed to lower HR. Esmolol 1 mg/kg was injected again and there was also no effect. It presented exacerbating her hemodynamic deterioration because of inadequate diastolic filling resulting from her rapid HR. The conventional strategy had proven to be ineffective. We decided to attempt to lower the HR with neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, typically used to reverse neuromuscular blockade in anesthetized patients. Initially, intravenous boluses of neostigmine 2 mg were given. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial bolus, the HR began to fall and remained stable at a rate of 60 to 80 beats/min. The loading dose of neostigmine reduced HR within minutes, associated with improvement in systemic perfusion. This suggested that neostigmine control of tachycardia contributed significantly to a dramatic reversal of cardiogenic shock in this patient. PTU 200 mg and hydrocortisone 200 mg were also administered. Initial laboratory thyroid function analysis showed a suppressed TSH < 0.02 mU/L, with free thyroxine (FT4) 6.1 ng/dL and TT3 7.0 nmol/L.\nSurgical procedure lasted for 4 hours, HR and BP were stable with total fluids 2500 mL. Patient was transferred to ward after extubation with a PCA pump when the continuous monitoring shown all her vital signs were stable. She was administered hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours and PTU 200 mg every 6 hours.[ The patient was continued on hydrocortisone 25 mg every 12 hours and PTU 200 mg every 6 hours and was discharge 7 days later after intensive treatment. Then she was transitioned to oral PTU 80 mg daily.\nEthical approval for this study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.",1.62,47.0,17.91
126669,"A 72-year-old man, 169 cm tall and weighing 56 kg, complained of general weakness and the diagnostic workup suggested lung cancer with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). To obtain a tissue diagnosis, the patient was scheduled for a mediastinoscopic biopsy.\nHe had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 55 years and had drunk one-and-a-half bottles of soju a day for 50 years. There was no history of neuromuscular disorders and no family history of neuromuscular disease. Four years earlier, he had complained of vertigo and gait disturbance for 1 month and a neurologist had suspected of encephalitis.\nPreoperatively, the routine laboratory values were within normal limits, except for hyponatremia (125 mEq/L). He had no symptoms or signs of hyponatremia, such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, depressed level of consciousness, agitation, confusion, muscle cramps, weakness, etc. After a nephrology consultation, we decided to perform the scheduled biopsy based on the absence of symptoms and signs associated with hyponatremia and the need to obtain a tissue biopsy to decide on treatment. Pulmonary function tests showed small airway disease.\nIn the operating room, routine monitoring was used, although neuromuscular transmissions were not monitored. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and succinylcholine. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane 1.5-3 vol% and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Intravenous vecuronium 4 mg was administered for muscle relaxation. Perioperative fluid administration was restricted due to the SIADH. The biopsy was obtained and the pathology showed small cell carcinoma of the lung. It took about 1 hour to incision closure from the time vecuronium was given.\nAt the end of the procedure, intravenous glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg and pyridostigmine 15 mg were administered to reverse the blockade, but the patient remained motionless and could not breathe spontaneously 40 minutes after reversal. Therefore, we administered atropine 0.5 mg and neostigmine 1.0 mg intravenously in case the dose of the reversal agent had been inadequate. However, there was no improvement in neuromuscular function. His pupils were equal and reactive. The oral body temperature was 36.2℃ and no antibiotics known to cause neuromuscular blockade had been administered.\nWe monitored neuromuscular function by attaching a nerve stimulator (TOF-Watch®, Organon Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). There was no twitch response to TOF stimulation, although there was a very weak response to tetanic stimulation at 50 Hz for 5 seconds with no post-tetanic potentiation. A blood sample was drawn to check the serum electrolytes. There were no abnormal values, other than a serum sodium that was lower than the preoperative level. We thought that sympathetic activation due to the operation might have led to significantly increased levels of ADH in the absence of volume constriction. We began to correct the hyponatremia with 3% hypertonic saline, slowly, to prevent cerebral edema or central pontine myelinolysis.\nAbout 2 hours after the end of the procedure, he began to move his fingers slightly and there were four twitch responses to TOF stimulation. However, there was no voluntary respiratory movement or eye opening. We believed that he was alert because he could move his fingers in response to verbal commands.\nHe was taken to the postanesthesia care unit and placed on a mechanical ventilator. With time, his hyponatremia improved slowly to within the normal range and his neuromuscular function improved. He could move his forearm and hands, but lacked sufficient muscle strength to breathe spontaneously and be extubated. We began to suspect a neuromuscular transmission disorder and a consultation with a neurologist established the diagnosis of LEMS by electromyography (). He was given anticholinesterase via a nasogastric tube, but there was no improvement in neuromuscular function. Two weeks postoperatively, all the laboratory values were within normal limits. He could sit up and write letters. However, weaning from the mechanical ventilator was impossible. He was discharged with a portable ventilator.",1.69,56.0,19.61
66948,"A 35-year-old right-handed Japanese man presented with a 1-month history of limited flexion and radiated pain in the left middle and ring fingers. He discontinued his work as a dentist because of the symptoms. A physical examination demonstrated an elastic hard nodular mass in his left palm with radiating pain. The active motion of the middle and ring fingers revealed loss of full flexion. The finger-to-palm distance was 10 mm. The passive motion was not restricted in all of the joints of the fingers. The left hand function was also reduced, with a grip strength of 35 kg in the right hand and 5 kg in the left. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was 14.5. The box and blocks test (BBT) score was 75 in the right hand and 55 in the left.\nThe laboratory test findings, including blood cell count and blood chemistry, were all within normal ranges. Radiographs of the hand revealed no remarkable findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2 × 1.5 × 1 cm mass of low intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity compared with normal muscle on T2-weighted images and gadolinium enhancement (). 2-[18F]-Fluoro-2 deoxy-D glucose positron emission tomography revealed increased uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.73 in the mass.\nAfter biopsy, he underwent resection of the tumor. The tumor had adhered to the flexor digitorum profundus of both the third and fourth fingers (). From which tendon the tumor arose could not be determined from the operative findings. The tumor, which was grossly firm and white-colored, was carefully dissected from the flexor tendons and neurovascular structures.\nThe external surface of the mass was smooth and glistening without any gross abnormalities or disruption and measured 2.0 × 1.3 × 0.9 cm (). The lesion was well circumscribed and contained fibroblastic spindle cells in a collagenous background, and some inflammatory cells were seen. There was generally no atypia. Elongated, slit-like spaces were prominent (). β-Catenin immunohistochemistry showed no nuclear staining.

108825,"A 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in August 2018, complaining of worsening generalized weakness and dyspnea.\nThe patient could hardly walk without oxygen mask, presenting with cyanosis and clubbing fingers for 16 mo, and progressive dyspnea for 1 mo.\nThe patient denied any history of pulmonary and cardiac disorders, and alcohol abuse. When he was 10 years old, his height was 125 cm (-2.5 SD compared to age and sex matched boys). Further investigation found multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (low thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, low cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone at 8 am, and low IGF-1 levels). Hypopituitarism was diagnosed based on laboratory findings. Magnetic resonance imaging showed aplasia of the pituitary gland, interrupted pituitary stalk, and ectopic posterior bright spot (Figure ). A diagnosis of pituitary stalk interruption syndrome was made. Levothyroxine 50 μg per day and hydrocortisone 20 mg per day were started. His poor compliance made him take these medicines occasionally. To achieve ideal height, his recombinant human GH (rhGH) treatment was started at the age of 14 years, and lasted for 5 years. At the age of 23 years, he was diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It gradually deteriorated to cirrhosis in the following 6 years.\nThe patient was 187 cm in height, 105 kg in weight, and 117 cm in waist circumference. His BMI was 30 kg/m2. Oxygen saturation was 78% on room air, and could increase to 92% with oxygen mask. His blood pressure was 128/79 mmHg and resting heart rate was 66 bpm with a regular rhythm. Physical examination revealed acanthosis nigricans, barrel chest with clear bilateral respiratory sounds, cyanotic lips, and clubbed fingers (Figure ). Hepatomegaly was palpable 4 cm beneath the xiphoid and 8 cm beneath the right costal margin. Splenomegaly was also palpable. Gynecomastia (Tanner stage IV) and prepubertal testicular size of 3 mL could be observed.\nLaboratory results indicated multiple pituitary hormones deficiency. Pulmonary function test showed decreased infiltration of oxygen from pulmonary alveoli into the blood. Common causes for cirrhosis, especially hepatitis B virus infection, were ruled out by serological evaluation (Table ). Activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio were within normal range, but prothrombin time was 14.9 s (normal range: 11-13 s).\nGastric varices were observed by gastroscopy (Figure ). Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhosis and hypersplenotrophy without ascites (Figure and ). There was no evidence of an intracardiac shunt on echocardiography, and the ejection fraction was 52%. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography revealed opacification of the left chambers of the heart by micro-bubbles five heartbeats after the appearance of microbubbles in the right atrium, suggesting intrapulmonary shunting (Figure ). 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin perfusion lung scan demonstrated intrapulmonary arterio-venous right-to-left shunting with a shunt rate of 64.4% (Figure , top).",1.87,105.0,30.03
117341,"A 31-year-old woman presented with a consistent, mild elevation of serum bilirubin lasting about 28 years. Physical examination after admission to our hospital showed that she was febrile, with normal blood pressure and heart rate, and of height 160 cm and weight 50 kg. She had no skin rash, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly, and no tenderness on palpation of the abdomen. Her skin and sclera, however, were noticeably yellow. Her family history was negative. Tests performed to determine whether she had jaundice showed increased concentrations of total serum bilirubin (T-Bil 103.9 μmol/L) and direct bilirubin (D-Bil 41.8 μmol/L), along with fever, vomiting, and scleral icterus. She was serologically negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses; Epstein-Barr virus; and cytomegalovirus. Her liver and bile duct system were normal on ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. 99mTc-HIDA cholescintigraphy revealed prolonged visualization of the liver and delayed filling of the gallbladder. Her serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, α-antitrypsin, copper, ceruloplasmin, and thyroid hormones were all within normal ranges. Her sweat chloride concentration and screening biochemistries for metabolic diseases were also within normal ranges, and she was negative for tumor-associated antigens and autoantibodies.\nMicroscopic examination of the liver biopsy tissue showed deposits of black pigment in liver cells. This pigment displayed staining properties of lipofuscin and melanin, with strong Schmorl positivity as well as strong autofluorescence []. Accumulation of melanin-like pigment represented a characteristic histomorphologic feature of DJS [].\nThe study protocol was approved without restrictions by the Medical Ethics Committee of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents. Blood (2 ml) was drawn for Sanger sequencing from the patient, her healthy parents, and 100 unrelated normal controls. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA of the entire coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of UGT1A1 (NM_000463.2) and ABCC2 (NM_000392.3) in the patient revealed two novel mutations []: a heterozygous in-frame insertion deletion mutation c.4712_4720delinsGGCCCACAG in exon 31, inherited from her father, and a heterozygous mutation p.I448V in exon 10, inherited from the mother. Neither of these mutations had been observed in the dbSNP and 1000 genomes databases indicating that these variants are very rare. In addition, the patient appeared to be homozygous for the A(TA)7 TAA allele and the T>3279G mutation [] in the UGT1A1 promoter.\nTo further test if these two novel mutations are indeed potential pathogenic factors, the ABCC2 sequence variations resulting from c.4712_4720delinsGGCCCACAG and p.I448V were both tested by MutationTaster, with both found to be disease-causing mutation. Based on PolyPhen-2 (Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA), the I448V mutation was found to be “probably damaging” to protein structure and function, with a score of 0.999. In addition, the I-Mutant 2.0 server, which predicts the change in free energy (sign of DDG), found that the new p.I448V mutation decreased the stability of the protein [].",1.6,50.0,19.53

He is the younger of two siblings from a second degree consanguineous marriage. He was a normal full-term baby, with no prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal complications with up-to-date immunizations. His mental development was normal. On examination, his vital signs were normal, his weight was 47 kg (25 percentile) height: 143 cm (25 percentile) []. He looked older than his stated age; he had acromegaloid features (enlarged hands and feet, big ears and prominent mandible prominent orbital ridges) [Figures and ], absence of subcutaneous fat in the extremities, face and trunk; prominent pectoral and calf muscles [Figures and ]. He had acanthosis nigricans in the neck, axillae and groins []. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Cardiovascular evaluation was normal with no evidence of retinopathy. Investigations: Fasting blood sugar 182 mg/dl, post prandial blood sugar of 342 mg/dl, urinalysis showed +2 of glucose and absent ketones. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose revealed persistent hyperglycemia (250-350 mg/dl). Serum insulin was elevated to 68 μIU/Ml (normal up to-23 μIU/Ml) suggesting insulin resistance and simultaneous glucose was 320 mg/dl. Level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 12.2% (4.3-5.8%). Tests for insulin antibody and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase were negative. Leptin level was 0.25 ng/ml (normal range: (18-37.4), his lipid profile revealed cholesterol - 339 mg/dl (114-203 mg/dl), high-density lipoprotein <20 mg/dl (40- 60 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein - 223 mg/dl (<130 mg/dl), triglycerides - 844 mg/dl (29-99 mg/dl). Complete blood picture and levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within the normal range. Liver function tests revealed bilirubin 11 umol/l (normal <20 umol/l), alanine aminotransferase 186 IU/1 (normal <50 IU/l), aspartate aminotransferase 123 IU/1 (normal <50 IU/l); alkaline phosphatase 108 IU/l, (normal <350 IU/1); albumin 38 g/l (normal range: 35-45 g/l). Viral hepatitis B and C screens were negative.

After neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX, he underwent robotic colectomy and resection of multiple bilateral liver metastases in November 2017. Adjuvant chemotherapy included FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. In August 2018 the liver metastases recurred and he underwent left hepatectomy including middle hepatic vein, intraoperative ultrasound and radiofrequency ablation of one lesion in segment 6 followed by chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. Another liver recurrence occurred in December 2018. A Kras wild type was identified and a new chemotherapy regimen with FOLFIRI and Cetuximab was started. A PET-CT confirmed liver-only metastatic disease. The CEA at that time was 8.3 and CA 19-9 14. The calculated Standard Liver Volume (SLV) according to the formula 11.5 x weight + 334 was 1,438 cc and the corresponding 40-50% of SLV was 575-719 cc.

15586,"An 84-year-old man presented with frequent episodes of syncope due to hypoglycemia and was diagnosed as a recurrent left pleural SFT. He underwent the left pleural malignant SFT resection with uneventful course at the age of 75 years. The laboratory examination before the first surgery demonstrated a fasting plasma glucose level of 43 mg/dl. The low immunoreactive insulin (IRI) level of 9.5 μU/ml at 2 h after a meal indicated suppressed insulin secretion, and the western blot revealed an elevated plasma level of high molecular weight IGF2.\nOn admission for the second surgery, his height and weight were 169 cm and 66 kg, respectively. His medications included antagonists of aldosterone, calcium, and alpha-adrenergic receptor. His blood pressure and heart rate were 120/58 mmHg and 90 beats/min, respectively. He had a giant left pleural mass (11 × 16 × 22 cm; Fig. ) and exhibited dyspnea. He had oral intake during the day and received continuous glucose infusion at a rate of 0.2 g/kg/h at night. His glucose level in the early morning sometimes decreased to approximately 30 mg/dl; thus, glucose boluses were administered as needed.\nAnesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium and maintained with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. The radial artery and internal jugular vein were catheterized to monitor the arterial and central venous pressure, respectively. After induction, a 20-gauge peripheral catheter (Becton Dickinson Insyte™, UT, USA) was inserted into a lower-extremity vein and connected to an AP, STG-55 (Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan); continuous blood glucose measurement was then started. The target blood glucose concentration was set at approximately 150 mg/dl. The patient’s blood glucose concentration was 58 mg/dl immediately after anesthetic induction; then, we infused 10 g of glucose. Insulin (1 unit/ml) and 10% glucose were automatically and continuously infused from the central venous catheter. The blood glucose level was charted over time to visualize the patient’s glycemic fluctuation during the operation (Fig. ). The blood glucose level was stable at around 150 mg/dl during surgery, while the difference between the glucose values of the AP and those measured by arterial blood sampling was within approximately 10 mg/dl. The operation time was 178 min, anesthesia time was 278 min, bleeding volume was 1190 ml, and packed red blood cell transfusion volume was 560 ml. The AP was disconnected from the patient at the end of the surgery. The postoperative blood glucose levels were measured 20 times for 4 days at intensive care unit, and totally, 8 units of insulin were administered (Fig. ). After discharge to the ward, his glucose levels were measured 3 times a day within the normal range. Although he spent almost 10 days to start oral glucose intake and approximately 3 weeks undergoing rehabilitation, his postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged with no complications.",1.69,66.0,23.11
160298,"One month before visiting our pain clinic, a 68-year-old female patient with vesicles and pain on the left side around the navel was diagnosed with herpes zoster and received treatment at a local hospital. Although the skin rash improved, the patient, at times, felt squeezing sensations on her left flank. When the patient was referred to the pain clinic, the patient had a squeezing pain and scars of vesicles on the T10 dermatome level on the left side and her numeric rating scale (NRS) was 5 (out of 10). She felt the squeezing pain several times for approximately one minute each time. Aside from a history of hypertension, there was no other unusual medical history or a history of prior surgeries. She was 152 cm tall and 51.2 kg in weight. Laboratory examinations showed no signs of bacteria or viral infection. Complete blood cell count, prothrombin time and activated partial thrombin time tests showed normal results, and there were no abnormal results in the serologic tests (HBs Ag/Ab, HIV Ag/Ab, quantitive VDRL).\nAfter diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia, the patient received an epidural block once a week for a total of six weeks. We performed the epidural block with 8 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine with the paramedian approach to T10-T11 with the 'loss of resistance' method. Out of six total procedures, only the first procedure included 20 mg of triamcinolone with local anesthetics, and the rest were composed of local anesthetics only. Any signs or symptoms suggestive of dural puncture, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aspiration through the block needle, headache, paresthesia or sensory impairment were not observed during each epidural block. Pregabalin 150 mg and amitriptyline 5 mg were also prescribed for twice a day. After each epidural block, a pain free period continued for two or three days but she felt numbness like prior to the procedure. Additionally, the squeezing pain reappeared but the pain intensity was reduced to NRS 3. Thus, we expected full recovery by repetitive epidural blocks and by an additional root block or transforaminal epidural block.\nTwo days after the sixth epidural block, the patient was admitted to the department of neurology, through the emergency department, because the patient felt continuous dizziness and motor weakness in both lower extremities. Five days prior to receiving the sixth epidural block, the patient began to feel slightly dizzy. However, the continual dizziness became extreme by the time the patient was admitted to the hospital. Motor weakness of the lower extremities was felt by the patient two days after the final epidural block. In addition, the patient had symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The patient also could not stand or walk alone. The patient's body temperature was 38.3℃ and she did not have any abnormalities on her skin. Physical examination showed a grade III motor weakness in both of the lower extremities, but the deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function tests were normal. Sensory impairment was not observed. She was referred to our pain clinic, because a complication during an epidural block was considered by neurologists. We reviewed the sixth epidural block, examining for any evidence of dural puncture, aspiration of blood and other abnormal events, but there were none. However, in order to be certain, we performed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CSF tests on the first day of admission. The MRI showed no signs of hematoma, abscess, or arachnoiditis (). No bacteria were detected upon CSF analysis. Considering the results, we were able to exclude the possibility of an epidural block complication. The CSF analysis results showed, however, a mild increase in the WBC count (49,000 count/mm3) and a protein level of 97 mg/dl. Virus serology test of the blood and the CSF showed negative anti-IgG and negative anti-IgM antibodies for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster. Two days after the patient was admitted, the patient complained of urinary difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted, resulting in discharge of 1,200 ml of urine through the catheter. The patient felt squeezing pain on the T10 dermatome level on the left side during her entire stay at the hospital.\nConsidering her clinical progressions and the increase in protein level in the CSF analysis, herpes zoster myelitis was diagnosed by the neurologist and appropriate treatments commenced. Three days after the patient was admitted, the patient was given intravenous acyclovir 1.6 g and dexamethasone 20 mg daily for two weeks. The patient also received exercise rehabilitation treatment while she was on the medication. After receiving treatment for one week, the patient was able to walk but had difficulty in standing up. The patient showed gradual improvement and four weeks later made a full recovery in motor function. The patient's urinary difficulty improved through urinary training and she fully recovered in eight weeks.",1.52,51.2,22.16

Blood investigations were in normal limits. General anesthesia was induced with IV fentanyl 150 mcg, propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 40 mg. A 39 Fr left-sided DLT was inserted, and the depth of insertion was confirmed with fiber-optic bronchoscope. Anesthesia was maintained with O2, air, and isoflurane. The patient was positioned right lateral and all the pressure points were well padded. After painting and draping, one-lung ventilation was initiated. Two 10 mm ports and one 5 mm port were put and surgery started. However, due to suspected iatrogenic injury to the left lower lobe, the surgery was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy. Further, intraoperative analgesia was maintained with intermittent fentanyl boluses. Thorough adhesiolysis, repair of lacerated lung and pleural toileting were done. Two chest drains were put and chest wall was closed. In view of open thoracotomy, we planned for continuous ESP block for postoperative analgesia. Maintaining the lateral position T2 to T7 area was cleaned and draped. At T3–4 level, a low-frequency (2–5 Hz) probe was placed longitudinally 3 cm away from the midline, and 18 G Tuohy needle was introduced in plane to the probe craniocaudally []. A volume of 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was deposited, following which the multiport catheter was threaded 4 cm beyond the tip []. The entry point was then secured by Tegaderm []. The patient was then made supine, reversed of muscle relaxation, and extubated when awake. The NRS on awakening was found to be 2/10 at rest and 3/10 on deep breathing. The patient was then shifted to HDU for further observation. 0.2% ropivacaine continuous infusion was started at 6 ml/h through the catheter for 48 h. IV paracetamol 1 g was administered 6 hourly and IV diclofenac 75 mg was administered 12 hourly. The NRS score was assessed as in the previous case. The maximum NRS score reported was 4 in the first 12 h. Next day in the morning round, the patient had pain during physiotherapy session and specifically at intercostal chest drain insertion site. The NRS score was 4/10 at rest and 6/10 during physiotherapy. A volume of 5 ml bolus of 0.2% ropivacaine was administered through the catheter along with IV fentanyl 30 mcg. Pain was relieved after 15 min and he could complete the session. On day 2, the maximum NRS score was 3/10 during physiotherapy. The catheter was removed, and for rest of the hospital stay, he received tablet paracetamol 1 g orally 8 hourly and tablet diclofenac 75 mg 12 hourly.

She lived on an outlying island of Japan close to northwestern Okinawa Main Island. She was diagnosed with bronchial asthma 7 years earlier, at which point treatment with salbutamol and inhaled steroids was initiated. She had recently developed common cold symptoms with yellow sputum. On presentation, she had a 1-day history of wheezing. She presented to a local clinic, where she received oxygen therapy via mask (5 L/min) and hydrocortisone (100 mg). However, the treatment did not alleviate her symptoms. She subsequently developed low oxygen saturation levels and was transported by helicopter to the emergency department. She was fully conscious and cooperative upon admission to the emergency department. Her main symptoms were dyspnea (Borg scale severity level 7) and tightness in the chest. Her wheezing was categorized as Johnson classification degree II. Her respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min. She was not able to lie down and remained in an orthopneic position. Her body temperature was 36.9°C (98.42°F). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.43 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count was 20 400 cells/µL. NPPV (V60 Ventilator; Respironics Inc, California, USA) was initiated due to hypoxia (P/F ratio, 163) using an NPPV mask (5 L/min; Confortgel Blue Nasal Mask, Respironics Inc). A nurse with expertise in respiratory care attached NPPV while assessing for the possibility of air leak. NPPV settings used were as follows: S/T mode; inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), 7 cm H2O; expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), 4 cm H2O; inspiratory time (I-time), 1.0 seconds; and inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2), 50%. Hydrocortisone (200 mg) was administered via intravenous drip, and a salbutamol metered-dose inhaler was incorporated in the NPPV circuit using a respiratory gas mixer (Aero Chamber MV, Trudell Medical International, Canada). Figure shows changes in P/F ratio, PCO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, and Borg scale levels at 30 and 60 minutes after the initiation of NPPV therapy. Her P/F ratio dramatically improved during the first 30 minutes along with improvements in PCO2, respiratory rate, heart rate, and Borg scale classification. After the initiation of NPPV therapy, her wheezing was resolved at auscultation. He subsequently shifted from the orthopneic to Fowler's position. Fetal heart rate (FHR), as assessed by the obstetrician using Doppler echocardiography, was 152 beats/min. She was transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the general ward. Oxygenation was stabilized to a level that can be coped with low-flow oxygen therapy, even if NPPV is temporarily discontinued after the P/F ratio is improved. Moreover, re-exacerbation of wheezing, dyspnea, tachypnea, and vital signs was not observed even if the NPPV mask was removed. Finally, NPPV and oxygen therapies were withdrawn. Bronchitis was suspected to have triggered the acute asthma attack, and she was treated with antibiotics. Inhaled steroids were administered. She was discharged on day 4 post admission. After discharge, her asthma was well controlled, and she was followed up by the doctor at the original clinic, under the advice of a respiratory specialist.\nFinally, NPPV and oxygen therapy were withdrawn.

119033,"A 17-year-old Thai female with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection who had received TIV for 2012-2013 in August 2013 presented at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute (BIDI) complaining of 2 days of fever, malaise, headache, cough, and sore throat in April 2014. She had been diagnosed with HIV infection confirmed by machine-based assay (ArchiTECT, Abbott, chemiluminescent test), particle agglutination test (Serodia HIV, Fujirebio), and immunochromatography test (Allere Determine or TriLine) at BIDI. Approximately 13 years prior to presentation, she received zidovudine (AZT) plus didanosine (ddI) from 2001 to 2005; AZT, ddI, and efavirenz (EFV) from 2005 to 2007; and has been receiving EFV plus lopinavir/ritonavir in combination (LPV/r) from 2007 to present. Before TIV was given in 2013, she had a CD4 count of 922 cell/µL (31%), plasma HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a body weight of 85.7 kg, and a height of 165 cm. She received TIV 2011-2012 on August 1, 2012, and TIV 2012-2013 on August 28, 2013. TIV in 2012-2013 included the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-derived strain using NYMC X-179A, the A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like strain using IVR-65, and the B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like strain using NYMC BX-39 derived from the B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/2009 strains. At presentation of influenza-like illness symptoms, the physical examination was unremarkable except for a body temperature 38.5°C and body mass index of 31.48 kg/m2. Because of a positive rapid influenza test (Quidel QuickVue Influenza A+B test), the patient was given oseltamivir for 5 days and the clinical symptoms resolved The positive rapid influenza test result was from the BIDI, Nonthaburi, Thailand, with a confirmatory PCR result from the Siriraj Influenza Cooperative Research Center, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The specimen was identified by the amino acid sequence of full hemagglutinin (HA) gene to evaluate the match between the influenza infection and TIV strains.\nTo perform nucleotide sequencing, total RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) from direct nasal swab specimens of a vaccinated person who had developed a PCR-confirmed influenza illness from the 2009 pandemic virus. The RNA sample was amplified for the complete influenza HA gene, and the amplified product was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The sequence was edited, aligned, and translated into an amino acid sequence by BioEdit program (version 7.1.11; available at ). The sequence was submitted to the GenBank database with the accession number of KU144591.\nshows the percentage of identity match of amino acid sequences of the full HA gene. The specimen of the present case matches TIV strains CA 07 vaccine strain, H1N1 A/Nonthaburi/102/2009, and H1N1 A/Thailand/104/2009 by 97%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. The matches of the specimen for H1N1 2014 isolates are 99% to 100%.\nTo perform phylogenetic analysis, the HA amino acid sequence of virus from the case was analyzed for its correlation with the sequences from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain, 2 Thai virus isolates obtained from the first epidemic wave (A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 and A/Thailand/104/2009), and 2 more virus isolates from 2014 (A/Thailand/NMA_1/2014 and A/Thailand/BKK_1/2014) See .

72821,"A 51-year-old male taxi driver was admitted to Fukuoka City hospital with high fever (40 °C) and a shaking chill despite his use of over-the-counter antipyretics. He was transferred to the emergency department about 14 h after the symptoms onset. His medical history included bronchial asthma, pneumonia, and a surgical procedure for the resection of bilateral orbital tumors at 40 years of age. The patient had neither a history of contact with sick persons nor of any travel abroad. His body height was 160 cm and his body weight was 52 kg.\nAt the time of admission, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 108/74 mmHg; heart rate, 90 beats/min; respiratory rate, 40 breaths/min; body temperature, 40.1 °C; and Glasgow Coma Scale, E4V4M6 (total 14/15). Upon physical examination, a swelling of the bilateral eyelids (Fig. ) and petechiae were detected on the conjunctiva. Some dental caries, purpura and petechiae were noted on the limbs (Fig. ), and 1–2 cm sized swollen lymph nodes noted at submandibular and inguinal areas were remarkable. Neck stiffness was not detected. Laboratory data on admission revealed high inflammation (white blood cell 13,500 μL, and c-reactive protein 12.29 mg/dL), normocytic anemia (Hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL), high protein and low albumin levels (total protein 12.3 g/dL and albumin 2 g/dL), renal failure (serum creatinine 4.52 mg/dL), hyperkalemia (6.12 mEq/L), proteinuria and hematuria (Table ). Computed tomography showed enlargement of the liver and bilateral kidneys (Fig. ) in addition to swelling of the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, and celiac lymphadenopathy.\nSevere infectious disease was suspected, and we started ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously every 12 h after drawing a blood culture. However, purpura spread rapidly and the progression of drowsiness and fever was sustained on the 2nd hospital day. We performed a lumbar puncture and the turbid spinal fluid analysis revealed meningeal inflammation (white blood cell count, 2370 /fields; protein, 293 mg/dL; and glucose, 16 mg/dL), which was compatible with bacterial meningitis (Fig. ). Gram-staining of the spinal fluid showed gram-negative diplococci. The blood culture also became positive for gram-negative diplococci. We strongly suspected that the septic status of the patient’s meningitis and bacteremia was due to N. meningitidis. We increased the dose of ceftriaxone to 2 g intravenously every 12 h. The patient’s general status and consciousness then improved and his fever subsided. On the 5th hospital day, the patient’s fever (38 °C) re-appeared with hypotension, hyponatremia and eosinophilia, which led to a suspicion of relative adrenal insufficiency due to meningococcemia. We started a daily intravenous administration of 300 mg hydrocortisone on the 7th hospital day, and tapered the regimen to a daily oral administration of hydrocortisone on the 11th hospital day. Ceftriaxone was stopped on the 12th hospital day. No recurrence of infection was observed and he was discharged on the 25th hospital day. The clinical course is summarized in Fig. .\nWe investigated the patient’s co-morbidities and performed microbiological analysis of the strain. His past surgical history (bilateral orbital tumors), his symptoms (swelling lachrymal glands and lymph nodes), the elevated levels of IgG4 (3200 mg/dL) and immunoglobulin E (304 IU/ml), and hypocomplementemia (C3 37 mg/dL, C4 7 mg/dL, and CH50 < 12.0 U/ml) were the characteristics of Mikulicz’s disease included in IgG4-related disease. Furthermore, a biopsy of the patient’s lymph nodes confirmed the presence of IgG4-related disease (IgG4/IgG index 100%). We prescribed oral prednisolone 30 mg a day on the 19th hospital day. In addition, the strain of N. meningitidis was identified as non-typable. The sequence type (ST) was identified as ST-11448, which belongs to ST-23 (ST-23 complex), the most common ST in Japan []. Moreover, we also analyzed the N. meningitidis strain according to PorA and FetA typing, which has a higher resolution power than that of ST, and identified that the PorA VR1, PorA VR2 and FetA were 5, 2–82, and F4–1, respectively. These results suggested that this N. meningitidis strain was a non-capsulated derivative of the domestic ST-23 strain. (See ).",1.6,52.0,20.31

29105,"A 1-year-old boy with end-stage Alagille syndrome was admitted to our hospital for evaluation as a candidate for LDLT. On admission, the patient's pediatric end-stage liver disease score was 18, and his mother, aged 43 years, was the only living donor candidate. The mother's height and body weight were 156 cm and 51 kg, respectively. Multidetector row computed tomography (CT) (Aquilion Precision™; Toshiba) was used for preoperative dynamic CT evaluation. We performed a simulation of the donor hepatectomy, which was performed using SYNAPSE VINCENT three-dimensional CT software (Fujifilm). The predicted left lateral segment graft volume was 196 mL, which was sufficiently large for the pediatric recipient because the graft–recipient weight ratio was 2.37%. Three-dimensional CT angiography revealed that A2 originated separately from the left gastric artery, A3 + A4 originated from the left hepatic artery, and the cystic artery originated from A4 (Figure ). In the donor operation, we harvested the left lateral segment graft with A2 and A3 + A4 with the cystic artery stump (Figure ). Each orifice was approximately 1 mm in inner diameter, which was considered too small to obtain secure anastomosis in the recipient in situ. Therefore, we planned back-table microsurgical hepatic artery angioplasty to combine the multiple hepatic artery orifices into one orifice. In this case, we considered that the arteries might kink or twist after hepatic artery reconstruction, if the cystic artery stump, which was turned over, was anastomosed with the A2 stump (Figure ). In detail, the graft had two orifices (one was the A2 orifice, and the other was the origin of A3, A4, and the cystic artery), but these orifices were not used as is, for anastomosis. We divided A4 at the proximal cystic artery branching (stump of the original artery for A3, A4, and the cystic artery; Figure ), and anastomosed the proximal stump orifice of A4 and the A2 orifice first, and then the origin artery for A3, A4, and the cystic artery, and the newly anastomosed A2 (proximal stump of A4, cystic artery) was used for anastomosis with the recipient's hepatic artery (Figure ).\nWe sacrificed A4 by dissecting the proximal conduit to the bifurcation of the cystic artery, and we ligated the distal stump of A4 because of the left lateral graft and the original artery of A3, A4, cystic artery stump was anastomosed with the A2 stump in an interrupted pattern under the surgical microscope during back-table angioplasty, to avoid redundancy in the shape of A2 and A3 after angioplasty. We anastomosed the A3 + A4 conduit (original artery for A3, A4, and the cystic artery stump) to A2 to replace the hepatic artery because the caliber of the left gastric artery was not a size match to the A3 + A4 conduit, and the length of A2 was sufficient to anastomose to the A3 + A4. In the recipient, the single stump of the graft was anastomosed to the recipient's right hepatic artery, which was approximately 1 mm in diameter, using an interrupted pattern under the surgical microscope (Figure ). It took 19 minutes for ex vivo- and 32 minutes for in situ hepatic artery reconstruction. Total arterial reconstruction time was 51 minutes. The flow in the reconstructed artery was 110 mL/min.",1.56,51.0,20.96
60328,"A 31-year-old G1P0 woman with six weeks of amenorrhea and a positive urine pregnancy test presented to the obstetrics emergency department due to moderate/heavy vaginal bleeding with three days of evolution, with no pain nor other associated symptoms. She had been observed in an obstetrics consultation at the onset of symptoms and was diagnosed with an early miscarriage. It was recommended to have a follow-up ultrasound within a week. Her past medical and surgical history was irrelevant, except for laser vaporization of the cervix due to persistent low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. In terms of biometrics, she weighed 85 kg and was 1.72 m high (body surface of 2 m2). Vital signs were normal, with blood pressure of 136/81 mm Hg and pulse rate of 87 bpm. On physical examination, she presented with clots in the vagina in moderate to abundant amounts, and the cervix was enlarged and violet in color (Figure ).\nTransvaginal ultrasound revealed at the cervical level, in the thickness of the posterior lip, a gestational sac measuring 35 x 27 mm, containing an embryo measuring 8 mm with no cardiac activity (Figure ).\nThis cervical thickening caused an ""8"" figure of the uterus (Figure ).\nIn the endometrial cavity, an anechogenic image was detected, measuring 19 mm, without trophoblastic reaction and no visible embryonic structures, suggesting intracavitary blood retention. The initial hCG value was 72.194 mIU/mL. She had mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL. Other laboratory values were within normal limits: normal platelets, coagulation tests, and liver and renal functions.\nAccording to the diagnosis and since the patient was nulliparous and wished to preserve fertility, an inpatient conservative approach was the therapeutic option. An intramuscular dose of systemic methotrexate 100 mg (50 mg/m2) was initially administrated. Since the hCG values ​​remained high and the echographic dimension of the gestational sac was similar, four days after an intra-amniotic injection of methotrexate 50 mg was performed (Video ).\nOn the 12th day of hospitalization, due to worsening vaginal bleeding, selective embolization of the cervical branch of the left uterine artery was undertaken (Figure ).\nThe next day, the surgical removal of trophoblastic tissue was carried out under general anesthesia. The curettage was performed under ultrasound guidance, with an easy detachment of the trophoblast and minimal blood loss. The surgical specimen was sent to the pathology laboratory (Figure ).\nOn the second postoperative day, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The clinical evolution was favorable. Follow-up included a weekly control of hCG, which became negative on the fourth week after discharge (49th day after diagnosis). Transvaginal ultrasound done on the first and second week after discharge still showed at the cervical level a nodular and cavitated image measuring 18 x 13 mm (Figure ), with mild peripheral vascularization (Figure ), suggesting residual trophoblastic tissue in resorption.\nOn the third week, the ultrasound was completely normal. Currently, the patient is clinically well under oral contraception.",1.72,85.0,28.73
11565,"A 14-year-old female was referred by her paediatrician in outpatient clinic on 30 January 2018 for an elective hospital admission on 1 February, 2018. She was referred because she had recently lost weight; was complaining of a 2-week history of intermittent epigastric abdominal pain; and, upon investigation, the paediatrician found that she had an iron deficiency anaemia and an epigastric/left upper quadrant mass was found on clinical examination. She had lost 1 kg of weight in the past week, but had a normal appetite. The abdominal pain was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or other constitutional symptoms. She had noticed some dark stools, (consistent with her being on Ferrograd C) and a slight reduction in her exercise tolerance, but felt well within herself.\nShe had been seen in the paediatric outpatient clinic due to her history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Other relevant past history includes delayed puberty and poor growth, with poor weight and height gain in the past 3 years. Further history revealed that she had been suffering from the abdominal mass and abdominal pain for approximately a year, having had roughly 3–4 episodes during this time. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered in June 2017 to investigate, which showed no abnormalities, apart from a small left kidney. The girl’s medications included Hydrocortisone, Fluticasone and Ferrograd C. Her mother provided consent for medical imaging and procedures.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a firm and non-tender mass in the epigastric and left upper quadrant region. Her abdomen was mildly distended, but soft and non-tender. Examinations of her heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Additionally, there was no evidence of mouth ulcers, skin changes, obvious alopecia or eye irritation. Her weight was 34.6 kg and height 146 cm (first percentile). Her vital signs showed no significant abnormalities. The differential diagnosis at this stage was thought to be of spleen pathology. The plan on admission was for laboratory investigations, stool tests, commence an iron infusion, an abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph. On admission (1 February 2018) her abnormal blood tests showed: Hb 76 g l−1 (L), MCV 67fL (L), Albumin 32 g l−1 (L), Ferritin <5 ug l−1 (L) and ESR 25 mm hr–1 (H). Extensive urine, stool and blood tests (including autoimmune, endocrine, infective and vitamin testing) were all negative.\nAbdominal ultrasound on the 1 February 2018 showed grossly enlarged lymph nodes at the left upper quadrant, free intraperitoneal fluid at the right iliac fossa and an atrophic left kidney with cystic changes in the lower pole. The paediatric team requested a second read, which found a prominent bowel with the cause of the findings unclear. The report conclusion stated that these findings were atypical for mesenteric adenitis and CT or MRI would be appropriate. However, on ultrasound, both radiologists missed the finding of a large thick and curved echogenic band with posterior acoustic shadowing (), which is typical of a trichobezoar. This diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other differentials including food remains, barium concretions (if used) and bile ileus. Given the initial abdominal ultrasound findings, a chest radiograph was requested to check for mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The chest radiograph was reported by the radiologist as having no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or any other pathology. However, the radiologist missed the subtle evidence of a trichobezoar on plain chest radiography. It is seen as a curvilinear shadow below (), and projecting into the gastric air bubble. This finding could easily have been confused for normal food contents. Later that evening, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with i.v. contrast was performed (). This showed a grossly distended stomach filled by a suspected solid content, surrounded by a rim of gas, occupying as much as 13 × 6 × 6 cm in size. Additionally, mild to moderate free fluid and adjacent perigastric nodes anteriorly were found with no obvious duodenal lesion found. The suspected diagnosis was a gastric bezoar. The following day the patient admitted to pulling/playing with her hair and eating a substantial amount of hair as a child, but denied having consumed any for years. The gastroenterology team were consulted and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organised later that day. This showed a large gastric trichobezoar with an associated gastric ulcer on the lesser curve of the stomach. The duodenum appeared unremarkable to the D2 segment. The general surgical team were subsequently consulted and she underwent a laparotomy, gastrotomy and retrieval of the trichobezoar on the 3 February 2018.\nShe recovered uneventfully post-operatively, being discharged from hospital after 4 days. Her last bloods before discharge were on 5 February 2018, which showed a Hb of 86 (L), MCV 73 (L), Alb 26 (L). She was discharged with nil issues from the general surgical outpatient clinic after her first visit 3 weeks post-discharge from hospital. On her most recent paediatric outpatient appointment on the 17 April 2018, she had been very well, with increased energy, exercise tolerance and her blood results had normalised.",1.46,34.6,16.23
15545,"The patient gave written informed consent for publication of this case report and any accompanying images, and the presentation was approved by the institutional review board of Juntendo University (JHS 18-027).\nA 67-year-old male, 170 cm tall, weighing 72 kg, was scheduled to undergo left lower lung lobectomy via open thoracotomy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. He had no relevant medical history, and his preoperative blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. We decided to preoperatively insert a thoracic epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia.\nOn the day of surgery, no premedication was administered. He was monitored by ECG, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry. Before general anesthesia induction, the patient was positioned in the right lateral position for catheter insertion. We initially attempted the epidural puncture at the thoracic (Th) 6–7 interspace, which we changed to the Th 5–6 interspace after 15 min due to difficulty in an epidural puncture at the original site. Using a right paramedian approach, an 18 G Tuohy needle (Perican® epidural needle, 18G × 80 mm, B. Braun, Hessen, Germany) was used for epidural puncture 1 cm caudal and 1 cm to the right of the spinous process. After confirming accurate placement of the needle tip in the epidural space by the loss of resistance to injection of normal saline, the epidural catheter (Perifix® epidural catheter, standard 1000 mm, B. Braun) was inserted via the Th 5–6 intervertebral space with no resistance. The final total insertion length was 13 cm: 6 cm through the skin and 7 cm placed in the epidural space. After the catheter was appropriately secured in place, the patient was turned to the supine position in preparation for general anesthesia. Before general anesthesia induction, we gave a test dose of 2 ml of 2% plain lidocaine via the epidural catheter, followed by administration of 50 μg fentanyl and 4 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine. We were able to confirm the loss of cold sensation around the left T5 area 5 min after local anesthetic administration. After induction of general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube was performed to enable single lung ventilation during surgery.\nAt the beginning of surgery, an approximately 12- cm posterolateral incision was made at the level of the fifth to sixth intercostal space. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, suggesting the adequacy of analgesia in the incision area. However, when the surgeon opened the thoracic cavity, he saw the epidural catheter below the fifth rib. The catheter seemed to follow the course of the intercostal nerve. The tip of the catheter could be seen 3 cm from the dorsal edge of the incision (Fig. a, b).\nFortunately, the catheter had not been severed during the surgical procedure. After discussion with the surgical team, we decided to withdraw the catheter via the skin of his back under direct observation by the surgeon in the surgical field. The catheter was successfully withdrawn and examined for intactness of the tip. Thereafter, intraoperative analgesia was achieved mainly by continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil and intermittent administration of fentanyl. For postoperative analgesia, a continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg (20 ml) fentanyl and 20 ml normal saline was administered as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) at the rate of 1 ml/h, with bolus doses of 1 ml and a lockout time of 10 min, the infusion being commenced in the latter half of surgery. The scheduled surgery was completed uneventfully without any complications.\nWe also performed TPVB under ultrasound guidance, injecting 20 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine in the paravertebral space, besides the Th5 transverse process, before the patient’s emergence from general anesthesia and while he was still in the lateral position.\nAnesthesia emergence and his subsequent recovery from anesthesia were uneventful. During the postoperative period, his numerical rating scale score ranged from 0 to 1 and he required a single administration of supplemental analgesic (15 mg pentazocine) and six IV PCA boluses within 24 h. He did not complain of any paresthesia around the intercostal region. He was discharged from the hospital without any paresthesia or complications on the fifth day after surgery.",1.7,72.0,24.91

She was under the regular care of a general practitioner (GP), a nephrologist, a cardiologist, an ophthalmologist and an oncologist.\nHer medication consisted of acenocoumarol qd (dosing according to International Normalized Ratio, targeted range 2.0–3.0), metoprolol 100 mg qd, lisinopril 5 mg qd, torasemide 20 mg qd, simvastatin 20 mg qd, anastrozole 1 mg qd, ibandronate 150 mg monthly, lorazepam 0.5 mg qd, folate 5 mg qd, calcium 500 mg/cholecalciferol 400 IU bd, and zolpidem 5 mg qd as needed.\nDigoxin, 0.25 mg qd, and diltiazem, 90 mg qd, had been started exactly 1 month earlier by her cardiologist for AF with rapid ventricular response. In a letter to the GP sent 7 days after the patient was started on digoxin, the cardiologist mentioned the need for measuring the digoxin level and adapting the dosing, without specifying a deadline. He also reported intending atrioventricular node ablation therapy 5 weeks later.\nA detailed history given by the patient, her daughter, and the home care services revealed that on the 7th day after starting digoxin, the patient suffered a fall, which led her GP to stop diltiazem on the 8th day. On the 13th day, she had “digestive symptoms” and difficulty eating. From the 18th day on, she complained of significant loss of vision in both eyes, seeing “everything in white”.\nFive months previously, she had been routinely examined by her ophthalmologist. Visual acuity was 10/10 difficult in both eyes, and fundus examination disclosed the presence of slight retinal pigment epithelium changes compatible with early dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). On the 21th day of digoxin therapy, an emergency consultation at the eye clinic revealed decreased visual acuity in both eyes (4/10 OD and 5/10 OS), a mature cataract in the left eye and dry ARMD in both eyes. From then on, the patient lost 5 kg because of nausea and vomiting, and her vision remained severely impaired.\nHer symptoms varied from day to day but included blurry vision (she couldn’t read a printed text anymore), snowy vision (everything appeared to be bathed in a white light), a tendency to collide with objects on her right side, dyschromatopsia (she was seeing blue or purple spots when she closed her eyes, vivid colors appeared to be faded), formed visual hallucinations of little human figures that did not frighten her appearing either upon awakening (hypnopompic) or shortly before falling asleep (hypnagogic), and feeling as if she was on a fishing boat when lying in bed (proprioceptive illusions).\nDigoxin intoxication was suspected on admission 1 month after its initiation, and confirmed when the serum level was measured to be 5.7 ng/ml [0.8–2.0]. Other relevant laboratory results were as follows (reference range in brackets): creatinine 183 µmol/l [44–80], sodium 144 mmol/l [135–145], potassium 4.0 mmol/l [3.5–4.6], calcium 2.41 mmol/l [2.10–2.50].\nDigoxin was definitively stopped, and further levels were as follows (all samples were taken at 6 am, day 0 = day of ER admission): Day 3: 4.0 ng/ml. Day 10: 1.1 ng/ml. Day 18: not to be detected. On this basis, we estimated the half-life to be approximately 80–90 h in this patient at that time. Chest radiography, brain computed tomography scan and oesogastric studies provided no contributive finding in explaining the symptoms.\nAfter digoxin withdrawal, nausea and vomiting were first to disappear in the next few days. Her general condition then improved, the patient gained weight and benefited from a hospital rehabilitation program.\nOn the 17th day after ER admission, a detailed ophthalmological examination was performed. Visual symptoms were persistent, including snowy and blurry vision, peripheral fixed photopsias and dyschromatopsia, all compatible with digoxin intoxication, as well as formed visual hallucinations occurring systematically when the patient fell asleep (hypnagogic visual hallucinations). Visual acuity was decreased in both eyes (4/10 OD with S−1.25, C−1.5 at 103° and 5/10 OS with S+1.25) and color vision testing with Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates disclosed a severe red-green dyschromatopsia (only 1/13 plates correctly identified with either eye). Slit-lamp examination showed a pseudophakic OD and a mature corticonuclear OS cataract. Intraocular pressures were normal (12 mmHg OU). Funduscopy revealed normal optic nerve head with peripapillary atrophy OU, normal retinal vessels and bilateral minimal macular changes compatible with bilateral early dry ARMD. Computerised static perimetry (Octopus model 300) showed non-specific diffuse sensitivity loss consistent with bilateral diffuse retinopathy. Compared to our normative data for the age group, full-field photopic and scotopic ERGs confirmed a moderate diffuse dysfunction more pronounced for cones than rods (photopic and scotopic b-wave amplitude was decreased to 60 % of the lower normal values for the age). Qualitative interpretation of multifocal ERG disclosed a diffuse decrease of amplitude mostly in the central ten degrees.\nThe patient was finally discharged home 44 days after ER admission. She was still living at home 6 months after ER admission according to elicited follow-up. At that time, tests showed a subtle improvement of visual acuity (6/10 OD and 5/10 OS), persistent severe red-green dyschromatopsia (1/13 on Ishihara test OU), and a slight non significant amplitude increase on the multifocal ERG. Unfortunately, she denied further ophthalmologic examinations beyond follow-up at 6 months.",1.51,56.0,24.56
159368,"A 75-year-old woman (height 150 cm, weight 63.5 kg) was admitted to the hospital for phased total knee replacement on the both sides under the diagnosis of bilateral degenerative arthritis. She had no other specific diseases than osteoporosis. She had a history of a right shoulder joint replacement and a lumbar discectomy. Blood test, EKG, chest x-ray, and pulmonary function test performed prior to surgery were within normal ranges, and echocardiography showed ejection fraction of 60%, and manifested diastolic dysfunction of the left atrium. The patient's blood type was O Rh-positive and the preoperative cross matching and antibody screening test turned out to be negative. Under general anesthesia, right total knee replacement arthroplasty was first performed and after surgery she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs). After transfusion, there was no episode of transfusion reaction.\nTwo weeks after surgery, preoperational test for left total knee replacement indicated that hemoglobin level was 10.2 g/dl and hematocrit was 29.2%, and the antibody screening test was negative. On surgery day, she received 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate intramuscularly one hour before induction of anesthesia. In the operating room, EKG, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring and a pulse oximetry monitor were placed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 50 mg, and maintained using O22 L/min and N2O 2 L/min, and sevoflurane 2 vol% after tracheal intubation. For continuous monitoring of blood pressure and arterial blood gas analysis, 20 G catheter was placed to the left radial artery and central venous catheter was inserted to the internal jugular vein for central venous pressure (CVP).\nOne hour and 20 minutes after the onset of surgery when the total amount of blood loss was estimated more than 800 ml, transfusion of packed RBCs was started. A cross-matching test turned out to be negative again, suitable for transfusion. During transfusion, the patient showed stable vital signs. Five minutes after 1 unit of packed RBCs was transfused, red-colored urine, which was suspected as hemoglobinuria, was observed. For immediate treatment, fluid was administered while 10 mg furosemide was injected. Then we asked the Department of Laboratory Medicine to conduct ABO-Rh blood typing test of the patient's and the donor's blood, cross-matching, antibody screening test, direct anti-globulin test (DAT) and indirect anti-globulin test (IAT), and urinalysis. Hereafter, no big blood loss developed and the surgery was completed without further transfusion. Except for the incidence of red-colored urine sustained during surgery, patient's vital signs were stably maintained. At the completion of surgery when her spontaneous respiration and consciousness were confirmed, she was extubated and transported to the recovery room.\nRed-colored urine sustained even in the recovery room, but the color was waning and the patient's vital signs were normal, so she was referred to a ward. Post-operative test results showed that the transfused blood and patient's blood were compatible and that antibody screening test result was negative. IAT was negative while DAT was positive. Cross-matching turned out to be negative again. Urinalysis findings indicated 3+ blood, 0 RBC/HPF, and 2+ protein. Examination of patient's blood tested by an independent laboratory to determine more exact cause revealed that anti-Dia antibody was identified in an unexpected antibody screening test.\nSince the next day of surgery, red-colored urine was not observed, which made additional urinalysis unnecessary. Hemoglobin level measured right after surgery was 8.7 g/dl, showing a decrease, but thereafter no significant change further took place and BUN and creatinine level also sustained in the normal range, not followed by any other transfusion reaction. Then, she was discharged without any complications.",1.5,63.5,28.22
71824,"A 50-year old man (56.3 kg, 171 cm) with schizophrenia was scheduled for m-ECT. He had previously undergone ECT without anesthesia (i.e., unmodified ECT) for about 20 years, which was replaced with m-ECT because he developed a calcaneal fracture. Although preoperative blood tests indicated hypoproteinemia (total protein 6.2 g/dl, albumin 2.9 g/dl), his liver and renal functions appeared to be normal. His current medication included oral paliperidone (6 mg), aripiprazole (6 mg), chlorpromazine (100 mg, two times per day), and intramuscular injection of 50 mg risperidone.\nAfter obtaining written informed consent, a series of m-ECTs was performed. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and electrocardiogram were monitored during the procedure. Ventilation was assisted with a face mask using 100 % oxygen. The electrical stimulus was delivered via bifronto-temporal electrodes. The dose of propofol and NMBAs used in each treatment is shown in Table . Pirenzepine (10 mg) was injected to reduce oral discharge and inhibits gastric acid secretion in most cases. In the first treatment, his spontaneous breathing was not fully restored even 20 min after the stimulus. Hence, the anesthesiologist inserted a laryngeal mask just before moving to the recovery room and assisted his ventilation with a flow inflating bag for 15 min. He remained in the recovery room for about 50 min and was moved to the ward after confirming consciousness and stable respiration. In the second treatment, the first spontaneous breath appeared more than 15 min after the stimulus despite reducing the SCC dose to 20 mg. SCC was further reduced to 10 mg in the third and fourth treatment sessions; in both cases, the first spontaneous breath appeared 15 min after the stimulus. Finally, the SCC dose was reduced to 5 mg (0.09 mg/kg) in the fifth treatment session, with which the time to first spontaneous breath was shortened to 5 min.\nAfter the first series of m-ECTs, we obtained a sample of the patient’s blood to uncover the cause of the unexpected delayed recovery from muscle relaxation following administration of SCC. We also attempted to test the dose-response to SCC under neuromuscular monitoring using a train-of-four (TOF)-Watch SX (Organon, Roseland, NJ, USA) in the seventh treatment. The data acquired from the TOF-Watch was stored in a personal computer via a fiber-optic cable. The ulnar nerve was supramaximally stimulated with a square pulse of 0.2-ms duration, delivered as train-of-four (TOF) pulses at intervals of 15 s. The resulting contractions of the adductor pollicis muscles were quantified by an acceleromyographic monitor. Calibration was performed, and baseline responses were recorded after propofol administration and before muscle relaxant administration, with the neuromuscular monitoring continued until he was moved to the recovery room. For anesthesia induction, propofol followed by 2 mg SCC was administered in a titrated dose. An additional 2 mg of SCC was administered 1 min after the first administration, because the number of twitches observed (TOF count) was still four. At the same time, fasciculation of all the muscles was observed. Finally, an additional 2 mg (6 mg in total) of SCC was required 1 min after the second administration of SCC, because the TOF count was still four. T1 was assessed as being zero, 75 s after the third administration. Thereafter, the psychiatrist performed ECT. With this protocol, the first spontaneous breath was observed at 11.5 min after the ECT stimulus, and he was moved to the recovery room at 17.3 min after the stimulus. It took 19.5 min to recover to a TOF count of four. We obtained the results of the blood tests in the interval between the seventh and eighth treatments. Again, the tests indicated normal liver and renal function. However, his pseudocholinesterase level was extremely low (27 U/L, normal range 213-501 U/L), suggesting that delayed recovery from muscle relaxation following the administration of SCC was due to pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Hence, we decided to use rocuronium instead of SCC for future ECTs.\nIn the eighth treatment session, anesthesia was induced with propofol followed by 17 mg (0.3 mg/kg) ROC under neuromuscular monitoring. An additional 10 mg of ROC (27 mg in total) was administered 2.5 min after the first administration because the TOF ratio was 0.33. ECT was performed 1.5 min after the second administration of ROC. We administered 200 mg sugammadex 1.8 min after the stimulus, resulting in appearance of the first spontaneous breath 2.3 min after the electrical stimulus. An additional dose of 50 mg of sugammadex was administered 4.8 min after the stimulus because the TOF ratio was still 0.79. He was moved to the recovery room 6.8 min after the stimulus, after confirming that the TOF ratio was 0.96. Although an abdominal CT scan was performed after the eighth treatment to explore the cause of pseudocholinesterase deficiency, no abnormalities, such as liver cirrhosis or cancer, were detected. The gastroenterologist whom we consulted did not find a definitive cause of the pseudocholinesterase deficiency, although he pointed out poor nutrition as a candidate etiology. In the ninth treatment, ECT was performed when T1 was assessed as being zero, 4 min after ROC administration. Sugammadex (400 mg) was administered 1 min after the ECT stimulus. Spontaneous respiration resumed 1 min after sugammadex administration, and bag mask ventilation was not required 0.5 min thereafter, due to the adequacy of spontaneous breathing. The TOF ratio recovered to ≥0.9, 4.5 min after the ECT stimulus. He was moved to the recovery room 1.3 min thereafter. Almost the same anesthesia protocol was followed for the tenth to thirteenth ECT sessions, although neuromuscular monitoring was not performed. In our patient, SCC was used from the first to seventh treatment, while ROC-sugammadex was used from the eighth to thirteenth sessions (Table ). Blood tests performed after the last treatment still demonstrated low values (28 U/L) of pseudocholinesterase. We then compared the duration of electroencephalogram (EEG) seizures with SCC vs. ROC-sugammadex by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test (Fig. ) and found no statistically significant difference between them. The actual duration of seizures measured by the attending psychiatrist was also not different between the two NMBAs (data not shown). However, the duration for which the patient stayed in the operation room after the stimulus was much longer following ECT sessions with SCC as compared to those with ROC-sugammadex (Fig. , P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test).\nWe used either SCC or ROC as the NMBA for sequential m-ECTs in a schizophrenic patient with pseudocholinesterase deficiency that was diagnosed during the course of ECTs. Although the duration of seizures was not affected by the choice of NMBA, the combination of ROC and sugammadex shortened the time to return of spontaneous respiration, and hence, the time for which the patient stayed in the operation room after the ECT. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the effect of SCC and ROC during m-ECT in a single patient with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.\nWe previously reported the potential benefit of a combination of ROC-sugammadex as an alternative to SCC for muscle relaxation during ECT [, , ]. In patients without pseudocholinesterase deficiency, 8 mg/kg sugammadex produced equally rapid recovery from ROC-induced (0.6 mg/kg) muscle relaxation compared with spontaneous recovery from 1 mg/kg SCC during ECT []. In the present patient, we used 200–400 mg sugammadex (5.5 ± 1.8 mg/kg) for reversal of ROC (0.52 ± 0.02 mg/kg), while the dose of SCC used was 5–40 mg (0.24 ± 0.23 mg/kg), which is much smaller than the usual dose (i.e., 1 mg/kg).\nAlthough monitoring the TOF ratio seems to be a good method for assessing NMBA effect during ECT with non-depolarizing NMBAs, the TOF ratio has uncertain significance following administration of a single dose of SCC []. To overcome this problem, TOF count was used instead of TOF ratio to estimate the effect of SCC in the seventh treatment. We did not compare the time to recovery from muscle relaxation between SCC and ROC-sugammadex, because neuromuscular monitoring was only performed during some of the treatments. A definitive comparison of the NMBAs would require stringent documentation of the time to recovery of T1 to 10 and 90 % [–].\nIn this patient, the time to the first spontaneous breath after electrical stimulation in the seventh treatment was 11.5 min, while it was 2.3 and 2 min in the eighth and tenth treatments, respectively. The anesthesiologist permitted the patient to be shifted from the operation room to the recovery room once his spontaneous breathing was deemed stable enough. The duration that the patient remained in the operation room after electrical stimulation was much shorter when a combination of ROC-sugammadex was used, as shown in Fig. , suggesting faster recovery from muscle relaxation with ROC-sugammadex.\nSeizure duration was comparable between treatment with SCC and ROC-sugammadex, as shown in Fig. . This was inconsistent with our previous report which showed longer seizure duration with ECT following ROC administration than that with SCC administration []. This discrepancy may be caused by the order in which NMBAs were used in this ECT series. Indeed, the number of sessions of ECT seems to affect seizure duration, because of improvement in the depressive condition with ECT. Hence, the use of ROC following that of SCC may mask the longer ECT seizure duration with ROC administration.\nThe relatively high cost of ROC-sugammadex reduces its advantages during ECT []. Indeed, in the UK, use of ROC-sugammadex (4 mg/kg) for ECT reportedly increases the cost of the drugs used during ECT by 170 times as compared to SCC administration (£125.29 vs. £0.71) []. In our ECT series, the average drug cost, including anesthetic and vasoactive agents for ECT, calculated from the database of the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, was six times higher for treatment with ROC-sugammadex than with SCC (¥17,328 vs. ¥2,885).\nRecent evidence demonstrated a risk of anaphylaxis following administration of sugammadex [, ], although anaphylaxis induced by muscle relaxants, including SCC and ROC, is not rare. A recent report from France demonstrated that NMBAs were the cause of perioperative anaphylaxis in more than half the cases and that SCC was the causative NMBA in more than 60 % of such cases []. However, it is difficult to determine which NMBA is more likely to induce anaphylaxis. This is because the frequency of use of NMBAs is unknown. Besides anaphylaxis, SCC has a range of side effects, as mentioned before. Given the varied contraindications to the use of SCC, ROC may be a safer NMBA for ECT, particularly when it is used with sugammadex.\nThe advantages of use of ROC-sugammadex for ECT, including fast recovery from muscle relaxation and fewer side effects, may outweigh the high cost of its usage. The superiority of ROC-sugammadex for ECT is even more obvious in subjects with pseudocholinesterase deficiency, since spontaneous recovery from muscle relaxant effects after SCC is expected to be markedly prolonged in such cases.",1.71,56.3,19.25
51668,"The patient, a teenage male, 16 years old, mainly having a short penis for (16 years), was suffering from progressive weight gain (for 9 years), unstable walking (for more than 1 month). The mother did not take drugs during her pregnancy, and there was no history of exposure to any poisonous and radioactive substances. He is an off-spring of non-consanguineous parents, born full-term normal delivery, with cephalic presentation, no history of hypoxia, birth weight 3.3 kg, no complications such as obvious hypotonia and feeding difficulties after birth (The birth length is not known). The child was breastfed till he turned 2 years old, and while he started walking at 2 years old, he commenced talking later than his peers. The child also showed slow reaction since childhood, poor academic performance, mild intellectual disability and social fear. Movement disorder was noted in July 2020, needing a visual reference when he walks, otherwise he walked unsteadily. The patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 105 kg, and his BMI was, therefore, 43.70 kg/m2. According to the percentile curve of height and weight of boys aged 2 to 18 years old obtained from the physical development survey of 9 provinces and cities in China in 2005, the patient's height is less than 3% of the same age and sex in the same region, and his weight is more than 97%. Further, he had thick and black hair with a thick posterior hairline to the neck, thick eyebrows, wide eye-distance, collapsed nose, some beard scattered around the mouth, no Adam's apple, changed voice, armpit hair, and smaller hands and feet when compared to his peers. There was no breast development on either side. He had a thick vulva and pubic hair and pigmentation in the penis and scrotum, but there had been no obvious enlargement of his penis since he turned 9 years old, no morning erection and no spermatorrhea. The penis was found to be about 4 cm long in the non-erected state, and the left testicle's volume was found to be about 1 mL. The right testis was not palpable.\nBased on the patient's medical history, imaging examination and molecular genetic testing results, the diagnosis was SYS. Patient was advised to reduce weight, control blood lipids, blood glucose through appropriate strengthening of exercise and diet control in the future. At the same time, the family members were advised to provide mental training to the patients to strengthen their contact and communication with the outside world and improve the autistic symptoms of the patient. Because of the patient's bilateral cryptorchidism, it is recommended that the patient should be treated with bilateral cryptorchidism reduction fixation in the department of urology. After a follow-up of the patient for 2 months, the patient is still walking unsteadily and requires an auxiliary reference material to walk normally. There is no significant change in height compared to before, and the weight has dropped by about 2 kg in the past 2 months. The rest of the physical examination did not show significant changes. The symptoms of autism have improved slightly. The patient is willing to communicate with outsiders, his intelligence has not improved significantly, and his academic performance in school is still at the middle and lower levels.",1.55,105.0,43.7
138551,"The patient was a 55-year-old female who presented for evaluation of incoordination and gait disturbance. There were no issues during birth or early development. She was able to speak at 10 months and walked at 12 months. She had some learning disabilities, especially concerning visuospatial tasks, but was able to finish high school and earn a college degree with special education accommodations.\nAt age 32, she developed ‘head-bobbing’ stereotypies and mild facial chorea. Ataxic gait developed at age 37, at which time she was noted to walk as if she were intoxicated. She began to use a rolling walker at age 50 and required a wheelchair at age 52. Family history is significant for a second cousin (i.e. with shared great-grandparents) with ‘amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’, which in retrospect could have been DCS progressing to quadriparesis [].\nOn initial examination, she was microcephalic and exhibited dwarfism at less than 150 cm tall. She weighed about 40 kg. There were numerous facial scars from her 10 basal cell carcinoma excision surgeries. She had diffuse skin freckling. On mental status examination, she was alert and oriented to person and doctor's office, but not to date. There was significant cognitive impairment with ability to follow only one-step commands. Her small stature and overall demeanor were particularly childlike. She was very anxious and perseverated on statements such as being afraid of falling out of her wheelchair or requesting to go to the bathroom. She was able to perform the Luria sequence only by directly copying the examiner, and even those attempts were partially complicated by motor perseveration.\nOn eye movement examination, saccade initiation and velocity were diminished. There was no facial chorea; in fact, she had hypomimia. There was bilateral hearing loss. There were intermittent side-to-side and up-and-down head movements which were most likely titubation secondary to cerebellar dysfunction. In addition, there was moderate finger-to-nose dysmetria and bilateral upper extremity dysdiadochokinesis as well as involuntary movements likely due to a combination of ataxia and possible proprioceptive sensory loss (for online suppl. video , see ).\nUnfortunately, she could not cooperate enough for a detailed sensory examination. Sensation was grossly intact to light touch. She was able to protrude her tongue for 10 s, demonstrating a lack of motor impersistence. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished throughout. There was severe postural instability; hence, she was able to stand up only with assistance. Bilateral Achilles tendon shortening was present and contributed to difficulty in standing.\nCommercially available laboratory testing was negative for the Huntington's disease gene as a cause of chorea. A paraneoplastic antibody panel for anti-Ri, Yo, cancer-associated retinopathy, Zic4, amphiphysin, CV2, Hu, Ma, Ta, voltage-gated potassium channel, P/Q type voltage-gated calcium channel, glutamic acid decarboxylase, NMDA receptor (NR1), and ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Athena Diagnostics, Worcester, Mass., USA) was also negative. Additional commercially available genetic testing was negative for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1,SCA2,SCA3,SCA6,SCA7,SCA8,SCA10, and SCA17), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) as well as ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (aprataxin/APTX) and type 2 (senataxin/SETX), Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (SIL1), sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO/POLG1), ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED/TTPA), and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) (Athena Diagnostics). Neuroacanthocytosis is a concern in the setting of mental retardation, possible peripheral neuropathy, and chorea, but a blood smear was negative for acanthocytes.\nThere were no intracranial calcifications on computed tomography of the head, arguing against Cockayne syndrome (CS). MRI at age 54 revealed severe generalized atrophy (fig. , fig. , fig. ). Clinical diagnosis of XP was made by a dermatology consultant. Genetic testing for causative genes has not been performed because commercial testing is not available in the USA.\nAt age 55, the patient developed dysphagia to solids, resulting in aspiration pneumonia. She recovered after appropriate antibiotic therapy and now receives nutrition via a gastrostomy tube. Anxiety improved after starting escitalopram, but this medication had to be stopped after an episode of liver enzyme elevation. Given that an attempt to install a coating on her home windows to block UV light was unsuccessful for technical reasons, she was instructed to spend as much time as possible in the interior rooms of the house which do not have direct sunlight.",1.5,40.0,17.78

The patient denied prior injection or surgery to either wrist/hand.\nFollowing clinical and NMUS examinations, the patient consented to undergo EDX testing, which confirmed bilateral CTS and excluded other neuromuscular conditions. The patient consented to study participation and was offered PRP injection in wrist that received saline if PRP proved more effective at 6-month follow-up.\nThe study conducted in private outpatient orthopedic and sports medicine clinic from early April 2018 to late March 2019. The patient provided written informed consent before baseline data collection, which included numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) scores for each wrist/hand along with neurography and median nerve CSA measurements of both wrists/hands. The patient instructed in active tendon and nerve gliding exercises and provided a detailed exercise handout and journal for immediate post-injection period.\nBlood drawn and PRP prepared. Wrists randomly assigned to receive PRP or equal volume saline and blinded injections prepared. US-guided injections performed including median nerve hydrodissection. Following injections, wrists splinted and the patient provided verbal and written instructions for symptom management, avoidance of NSAIDs, and to begin prescribed exercises when symptoms allow.\nInitial follow-up 2 months post-injection patient’s exercise journal collected and exercises discontinued. NPRS and BCTQ scores, neurography, and median nerve CSA measurements performed for each wrist/hand at 2, 4, and 6-month follow-up visits. Following data collection at 6-month follow-up wrists unblinded and injectate revealed. As previously discussed, if wrist that received PRP showed more improvement than wrist that received saline patient could elect to have PRP injection and encouraged to follow-up 6 months later (1 year since beginning of study).

Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for NPRS is ~2.0 points []. Separate ratings collected for each wrist/hand.\nCTS-related disability questionnaire consisting of an 11-question Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) and an 8-question Functional Status Scale (FSS). Scores in both scales range from 1 to 5 points with higher scores equating to more 120 severe symptoms or higher levels of dysfunction and a value of 1 equating to the absence of symptoms or dysfunction. BCTQ has been shown to have good reproducibility, internal consistency, and validity in patients with CTS [, , ]. MCID for SSS is ~0.8 points and for FSS ~0.5 points [, ].\nNMUS was conducted by a regenerative medicine physician with 30 years of clinical experience and who is registered in Musculoskeletal® sonography by the Alliance for Physician Certification and Advancement and was blinded to neurography findings and injection assignment throughout study. NMUS performed using GE Logiq P9 system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with 12–15 MHz linear transducer. Short- and long-axis images obtained in each wrist and digitally stored including flexor retinaculum, flexor tendons, median nerve, carpal joints, and ulnar nerve in Guyon’s canal. Short-axis images stored of median nerve proximally at level of pronator quadratus muscle and distally at level of maximum enlargement for calculation of CSA using direct trace method inside echogenic epineurium [].\nFor the purposes of classification, increase in median nerve CSA of >2 mm2 comparing distal to proximal values considered diagnostic of CTS with 99% accuracy []. In addition, increase of median nerve CSA of ≥6 mm2 suggests “moderate” disease and ≥9 mm2 suggests “severe” disease.\nEDX testing was conducted by a physical therapist with 20 years of clinical experience and who is Board Certified in Clinical Electrophysiology by the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties and was blinded to NMUS findings and injection assignment throughout study.

Using in-plane approach, median nerve identified at inlet of proximal carpal tunnel at a level of pisiform bone [] and ulnar artery identified using Doppler imaging. A 25-gauge needle passed from ulnar side of wrist toward median nerve. Each wrist received 8 mL total injection volume and underwent median nerve hydrodissection from superficial flexor retinaculum and underlying sub-synovial connective tissue. Median nerve in the right wrist adhered more strongly to surrounding soft tissues and required 6 mL of injectate to achieve hydrodissection, whereas the left wrist median nerve required 3 mL of injectate to achieve hydrodissection. Following injection, carpal tunnel visualized in long-axis ensuring proximal-to-distal diffusion of injectate occurred. The patient observed post-procedure for 20 min and provided verbal and written instructions to avoid use of NSAIDs, apply ice for 10–15 min hourly as needed for pain relief, and begin prescribed exercises when symptoms allow.\nThe patient provided verbal and written instructions along with printed illustrations for performance of the following exercises in each wrist/hand: Index and middle finger tendon gliding and median nerve gliding (); cervical retraction and scapular retraction (). The patient instructed to perform exercises until 2-month follow-up visit and was provided an exercise journal to record compliance.",1.98,109.0,27.8
114675,"A 48-year-old male patient (65 kg, 175 cm) sustained bilateral orbital wall and maxillary fractures with a skull-base fracture after a motor vehicle accident. He was scheduled to undergo surgical intervention for the fractures. He had undergone brain surgery for epidural hematoma removal 11 days prior. As his level of consciousness was alert, intubation following the operation was unnecessary. As an alternative to tracheostomy, submental intubation was planned.\nThe patient was monitored with pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and noninvasive blood pressure measurements. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes, anesthesia was induced with propofol (80 mg) and rocuronium (50 mg). Following orotracheal intubation with a reinforced ETT (internal diameter, 7.5 mm), the tube was removed through the submental area using the aforementioned method.\nAfter the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was extubated at post-operative day 1.",1.75,65.0,21.22
78756,"This included 33-year-old, Caucasian male, 75 kg in weight and 1.66 meters in height, born through a normal pregnancy and delivery. Fourth sibling of nonconsanguineous parents, with family history of mitochondrial encephalopathy (), his mother with congenital deafness, died at age 48 due to an haemorrhagic stroke; two older brothers died at ages 16 and 34, with the diagnosis of Leigh syndrome; the patient's 34-year-old brother revealed cognitive impairment, polyneuropathy, and epilepsy; and two younger sisters revealed cognitive impairment, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and neurodevelopmental delay, respectively. The patient presented with fatigue, exercise intolerance, and learning difficulties since childhood. Despite cognitive deficits the patient lived independently with full function of daily living skills. In the last year he denoted progressive decline of the muscle strength. At neurological examination overall hypotonia and proximal tetraparesis, normal deep tendon reflexes in upper and lower extremities, and plantar flexor response bilaterally were present. We did not observe other signs, like atrophy, pyramidal signs, sensory, cerebellum, or cranial nerves dysfunction. For the remainder of physical examination, the patient had abnormalities of the joints, including hammertoes. There were no other systemic changes, including cardiac, endocrine, and hepatic dysfunction and no history of seizures.\nRoutine laboratory analyses like haemoglobin, haematocrit, white cell count, differential white cell count, platelet count, serum ion levels, albumin, glucose, creatine kinase activity, ammonia, and liver and kidney functions were normal; spinal cord and brain MRI were normal, with no significant foci of abnormal signal in the brain or in the cerebellum parenchyma; ECG and transthoracic echocardiography were normal. The remaining study highlights an increase in the determination of serum lactate 2.95 mmol/L at rest and 2.78 mmol/L after exercise (reference values 0.95–2.30 and 0.80–1.50, resp.) and lactate/pyruvate ratio of 25.0 at rest and 20.9 after exercise (ratio normal 10–28 and 11–18, resp.), as well as elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate; the nerve conduction studies (NCS) showed normal sensory studies but CMAP studies of upper and lower limbs were slightly reduced with normal range latency and velocity and without features of conduction block. The electromyogram (EMG) showed no spontaneous activity, polyphasic motor unit potentials (MUPs) with increased amplitude, increased duration, and decrease recruitment on right first dorsal interosseous muscle, extensor digitorum communis, biceps brachialis, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and vastus lateralis in lower limbs. Repetitive stimulation did not reveal decrement. NCS and EMG revealed signs of chronic neurogenic compromise that could suggest motor neuron dysfunction. Biopsy of muscle and nerve exhibited marked variation in the fiber size by the presence of large groups of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy of muscle fibers on healthy fascicles, “fiber-type-grouping;” a slight increase in the number of nuclear centralizations, lipid accumulation, and crescent-shaped subsarcolemmal hyperchromatic aggregates on oxidative reaction SDH corresponded to the accumulation of mitochondria. We were not able to detect clear “ragged-red fibers” in Gomori Trichrome stain. These features are suggestive of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with some mitochondrial alterations (Figures –). EEG showed generalized slowing without epileptiform discharges, with no ophthalmologic signs such as retinitis pigmentosa or optic atrophy. A genetic study revealed an apparent homoplasmic T>C substitution at nucleotide position 9185, in MTATP6, that replaces a highly conserved leucine to proline at codon 220 (p.L220P); the genetic study of SMA did not detect any homozygous deletion in exon 7 or heterozygosity of exons 7 and 8, in the SMN1 gene. The mitochondriopathy was confirmed, according to clinical and genetic criteria of Nijmegen Clinical Criteria for Mitochondrial Disease [] despite the atypical features. The patient performed thiamine (50 mg/day), coenzyme Q10 (400 mg/day), and L-carnitine (4000 mg/dia), for 1 year, with slight clinical improvement.\nThe patient's sister, 22-year-old fifth sibling, revealed mild cognitive impairment, ataxia, and exercise intolerance 6 years ago. Like her brother she was independent of activities of daily living. At exam we observed hypertelorism, pes cavus and hammertoes, proximal muscular weakness, and ataxia. The laboratory study highlights an increase of lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio in serum, at rest and after exercise; EMG revealed axonal peripheral neuropathy, predominantly in lower limbs; MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and muscle biopsy were normal. Cardiac study with ECG and transthoracic echocardiography were normal. The genetic study displayed homoplasmic m.9185T>C mutation. The remaining study was normal.",1.66,75.0,27.22
131157,"A 37-year-old female, a known case of bronchial asthma since childhood and who was on inhalers, was diagnosed about 2 months ago as hyperlipidemia and started on pitavastatin calcium 4 mg once daily, by her cardiologist 7 weeks ago.\nShe presented to the emergency room complaining of chest pain, a characteristic chest wall pain which was crushing in nature but with no cardiac origin. It had begun gradually 10 days before, was retro-sternal, was non-radiating, was severe 10/10 (visual analog pain scale), was aggravated by minimal exertion, and was relieved by rest. It was associated with shortness of breathing on exertion. There were no palpitations, syncopal attacks, nor fever. There was no past medical history of a similar condition and no previous hospitalization. Her bronchial asthma was well controlled on inhalers. She had no family history of similar condition and not known to have any other comorbidities. She is not a smoker and does not drink alcohol. She is a medical staff by profession and unmarried. On examination, she looked anxious, not distressed, fully conscious, and oriented.\nThe patient noticed that she had put on about 10 kg of weight in the previous 6 weeks. Before taking pitavastatin, she weighed 85 kg, and her height was 163 cm. Her weight had risen to 95 kg after she began pitavastatin. Her body mass index (BMI) was 35.8.\nHer blood pressure was 130/80 and heart rate was 86/min, regular. Cardiovascular examination was uneventful. Respiratory system was normal apart from a drop in oxygen saturation from 99% to 94% on walking a short distance. Abdomen was soft, not tender, and no mass was detected. There was no dependent edema.\nOne month before presentation, the lipid profile was as follows: serum cholesterol 8.2 mmol/L, LDL 6.24 mmol/L, HDL 1.63 mmol/L, and triglyceride 1.14 mmol/L, then dropped after 1-month treatment with pitavastatin to serum cholesterol 5.8 mmol/L, LDL 3.43 mmol/L, KDL 1.80 mmol/L, and triglyceride 0.85 mmol/L. Hemoglobin concentration: 12.7 g/dl, white blood cells: 11.2 × 103/μl, platelets: 164 × 10^3/ul, serum urea: 4.2 mmol/L, serum creatinine: 75 umol/L, serum sodium: 139 mmol/L, serum potassium: 3.9 mmol/L, serum osmolality: 281 mosm/kg, total protein: 73 g/L, albumin: 37 g/L, aspartate aminotransferase: 11 U/L, alanine transaminase; 23 U/, Vitamin D: 65, and troponin: 0.0004. Repeated serial troponin was normal as well creatinine kinase and creatinine kinase-muscle/brain. She had a normal thyroid function test. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiogram, chest X-ray, and ultrasound abdomen were all normal.\nComputed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism. CT coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries, no coronary arteries atherosclerosis, and no stenosis.\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac ward and started on telemetry observation. Arterial blood gas analysis was normal, and a 6-min walk test revealed a drop in oxygen saturation from 98% to 91% in room air, associated with severe crushing chest pain which affected her breathing. Pulmonary function test and sleep study were normal.\nAlthough rapid weight gain was to blame for all of these symptoms, all the investigations were negative. The patient was reassured that it was neither an acute coronary syndrome nor coronary artery disease and was discharged after 4 days of admission with full investigation and assessment of her chest pain.\nThe patient stopped pitavastatin on her own as a trial as she had read about its side effects especially with regard to chest pain. After 3 days, her chest pain and all symptoms such as insomnia subsided and completely disappeared. Accordingly, a final diagnosis of pitavastatin-induced chest pain was made, as a rare side effect of the medication.",1.63,85.0,31.99
69872,"A 12-year-old boy presented with recurrent fever for more than 2 years and was referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2014. The recurrent fever began without obvious predisposition and lasted 4 to 14 days per attack. The intervals between episodes range from 4 to 20 days. Temperature peak was up to 40°C. No cough, expectoration, rash, joint pain, or other discomfort appeared. He was referred to local clinics and had been diagnosed with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection many times with positive EBV antibodies (EBV-Ab) and elevated plasma virus copies. Details of his physical examination, laboratory results, and therapies were unavailable.\nHe visited a hospital in Beijing owing to another fever in February 2014. Enlargement of lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly were discovered in physical examination. Assay of EBV-Ab and virus copies were performed, which indicated that IgA/early antigen (EA), IgA/viral capsid antigen (VCA), IgG/VCA, NA-IgG were positive and the virus copies were elevated to 3.45 × 10^5/mL. Diagnosis of EBV infection was made and then ganciclovir was employed, which ameliorated his symptoms and reduced the virus copies.\nIn May 2014, his fever relapsed and then he was referred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for further treatment. Reviewing the history of the patient before the onset of recurrent fever, we found that he had frequent respiratory infections with twice a month. Physical examination indicated that his growth and development were within normal limits, weighing 38.5 kg and 146 cm in height (both in the range of the tenth percentile to the twenty-fifth percentile). Ichthyosis rash could be seen on his lower limbs. Several enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the anterior region of the neck. No erythema or exudate of the throat or enlargement of tonsils was observed. There were no obvious abnormalities with cardiopulmonary examination. On the abdominal physical examination, hepatomegaly was found with 2 cm below the ribs, medial hardness, and a clear margin. Spleen could not be palpated. No deformity of joints was found as well.\nOn laboratory examination, peripheral blood count showed a decreased number of neutrophils and proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils were inverse (63.2% and 25.9%, respectively). Acute phase reactants increased (erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 34 mm/h and C reactive protein was 15 mg/L). Liver function tests revealed slightly elevated glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (see Fig. ). Serum immunoglobulin was normal (IgG, 16.44 g/L; IgA, 5.24 g/L; IgM, 0.75 g/L) with decreased T cells in the peripheral blood (see Table ). Table summarizes the values of lymphocyte subsets changing with time and therapy. The numbers of CD3+ T cell especially the CD4+ T cell markedly decreased, while NK cell significantly increased. These abnormal results persisted despite treatment with cyclosporine A for 4 months from July 2015 to November 2015. Recombinant human interferon α-2a began to be used in November 2015 with a dose of 1 MU, 3 times a week. Four months later in February 2016, the above abnormality still existed despite the remission of his symptoms and improvement of other laboratory examinations. Dosage of recombinant human interferon α-2a was then added to 2 MU, 3 times a week. Henceforward, the values of lymphocyte subsets gradually returned to normal level. Positivity of EBV-Ab (see Table ) and elevated virus copies (1.5 × 10^6 copies/mL, see Fig. ) were observed. As we can see in Table , IgA/EA, IgA/VCA, IgG/VCA, NA-IgG were persistently positive no matter what treatment was used. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated hepatosplenomegaly (oblique diameter of right lobe of liver was 13.0 cm and spleen diameter was 14.3 cm). Cardiac ultrasound showed that he had patent ductus arteriosus.\nHis symptoms, abnormal signs, and laboratory indexes repeatedly occurred during the follow-up, which were improved with repeated treatment of ganciclovir. The diagnosis of CAEBV was established on the basis of diagnostics guideline proposed by Okano et al.[ The following aspects of our patient fulfilled the Okano guideline: recurrent infectious mononucleosis-like symptom include fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly; unusual pattern of anti-EBV antibodies with raised anti-VCA and anti-EA, and detection of increased EBV genomes in the peripheral blood; and exclusion of other chronic illness such as other infections, autoimmune diseases, and neoplastic diseases upon completion of related examinations.\nThe repeated use of ganciclovir could not prevent the frequent relapses of EBV infection for our patient. The combination of cyclosporine A for 4 months could not reduce the virus copies to normal level as well. With the possibility of immunodeficiency disease, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to analyze all known PID genes followed by Sanger sequencing to verify results. The patient possessed 2 novel compound heterozygous mutations of JAK3 (see Fig. ). The p.H27Q mutation came from his father, while p. R222H from his mother. Thus, his diagnosis was corrected for JAK3-deficiency PID and CAEBV. Antiviral therapy was replaced with subcutaneous injection of recombinant human interferon α-2a with 1 to 2 MU, 3 times a week since November 2015. The virus copies gradually decreased to the normal level and his symptoms ameliorated significantly. Moreover, ALT decreased to normal level after 3 months. His latest follow-up was in February 2017. He has hardly had a fever for nearly 1 year and the virus copies and ALT were normal.",1.46,38.5,18.06
59010,"A 25-year-old woman developed lower back pain after her first delivery. As time progressed, her lower back pain worsened. She was previously diagnosed with lower back sprain at another medical center and treated with physical modalities and analgesic myorelaxants. However, these treatments failed to provide pain relief. The patient was admitted to our medical center because of severe back pain after collapsing to the ground a month after delivery. She was unable to ambulate or transfer because of severe back pain, and also experienced difficulties with her daily activities. Due to her severe pain, the patient was unable to hold or breastfeed her baby so she used a breast pump for lactation. The patient reported that she had been completely healthy before pregnancy. She had no diseases that could cause osteoporosis and did not use any medications. She was a nonsmoker and had no family history of osteoporosis or thyroid disease. She weighed in at 47 kg with a height of 163 cm. Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\nOn physical examination, tenderness was observed in the thoracolumbar vertebrae and spasm of the vertebral muscles. Although her spinal range of motion was limited, there were no abnormal neurological symptoms or signs on physical examination. The pain was localized to the back. There was no numbness or weakness.\nA bone scan showed multiple compressions of the lumbar spine, consistent with the lumbar magnetic resonance image (Fig. ). Bone mineral density showed that the t score of the L1–4 spine was −3.5 and the z score −2.5 (Fig. A). Both the t score and the z score of the femur neck were −2.6 (Fig. B). In the thyroid scan, decreased trapping was observed in both thyroids (Fig. ). On thyroid ultrasonography, no abnormal nodules were detected.\nThe laboratory findings showed a total calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL (normal range: 8.1–10.4), plasma 25-OH Vit D level of 9.2 ng/mL (normal range: 4.8–52.8), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 31.1 pg/mL (normal range: 14.0–72.0), PTH-related peptide level of 1.1 pmol/L (normal range: 0–1.1), adrenocorticotropic hormone level of 19.7 pg/mL (normal range: 5.0–60.0), cortisol level of 7.31 μg/dL (normal range: 3.09–16.66), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 11 mm/hr (normal range: 0–25). However, there were increases in the alkaline phosphatase level at 4.7 mg/dL (normal range: 2.7–4.7), T3 level at 253 ng/dL (normal range: 65–150), free T4 level at 2.94 ng/dL (normal range: 0.78–1.54), thyroid microsomal Ab level at 1300 U/mL (normal range: 0.0–60.0), prolactin level at 90.20 ng/mL (normal range: 4.79–23.30 ng/mL), and estrogen level of 265 pg/mL (normal range: 61–437 pg/mL). In addition, the TSH level at 0.04 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.35–5.50) and progesterone level at 0.4 μg/mL were decreased.\nThe patient was advised to immediately discontinue lactation. In addition, a thoracolumbosacral orthosis was prescribed. A bisphosphate intravenous injection of 3 mg/3 months, elementary calcium at 1000 mg/day, and calcitriol at 0.5 μg/day were commenced. For pain management, analgesics and physical modalities were recommended. The patient underwent a lumbar facet block. An exercise program including back muscle strengthening, range of motion, and relaxation exercises, as well as weight-bearing exercises, was started. A month after rehabilitative management, her pain improved (visual analog scale score improved from 6 to 2). She was able to walk independently indoors. At the 3-month follow-up, she had only L4–5 focal area back pain, felt better, and was comfortable performing daily activities. There was no new vertebral fracture or progressive collapse of pre-existing vertebrae. She received antiosteoporosis treatment (ibandronate intravenous injection 3 mg/3 months, elementary calcium 1000 mg/day, calcitriol 0.5 μg/day) during the rehabilitation process. About 5 years later, the following measurements were found to be within normal range: total calcium level of 9.6 mg/dL (normal range: 8.1–10.4), intact PTH level of 30.4 pg/mL (normal range: 14.0–72.0), plasma 25-OH Vit D level of 12.1 ng/mL (normal range: 4.8–52.8), alkaline phosphatase level at 3.2 mg/dL (normal range: 2.7–4.7), T3 level at 119 ng/dL (normal range: 65–150), free T4 level at 1.47 ng/dL (normal range: 0.78–1.54), and TSH level at 1.05 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.35–5.50). Finally, the BMD score improved. It showed that the t score of the L1–4 spine was −1.9 and the Z-score was −1.8 (Fig. A). The t score and the z score of the femur neck were both −2.2 (Fig. B).",1.63,47.0,17.69
126767,"A 26-year-old woman at 41 weeks of gestation with a known history of vasovagal syncope was scheduled to undergo an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. She weighed 92 kg and was 165 cm tall. Two years earlier, she visited the hospital with complaints of frequent abdominal discomfort, cold extremities, cold sweating, and a brief loss of consciousness. Such symptoms began 4-5 years earlier. They lasted for 5-10 minutes and resolved spontaneously. She experienced episodes of syncope that was induced by many conditions. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope by a cardiologist and neurologist through a careful history and physical examination, echocardiography, treadmill test, Holter monitoring and positive tilt table test, and a β-blocker was prescribed (atenolol 25 mg/d). She stopped medication herself after a few days. The other pre-anesthetic assessment was unremarkable, with no medical problems except dizziness and healthy pregnancy. Initially, she planned a normal vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia. With the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and using an aseptic technique, a lumbar epidural catheter was inserted at the L3-4 interspace with rapid fluid administration and tested with 1% lidocaine 3 ml. She did not show any changes in vital signs, and was observed without a further epidural injection until a cervical dilatation of 5-6 cm.\nShe complained dizziness twice, which was resolved with bed rest and atenolol medication. During non-invasive fetal monitoring, the fetus showed variable heart rate deceleration and an emergency cesarean section was decided. No premedication was prescribed. She had a heart rate of 60-115 beats/min and an arterial pressure of 90-110/60-90 mmHg at the delivery unit. When the patient arrived in the anesthetic room, monitoring of the ECG, oxygen saturation and arterial pressure was started, showing a heart rate of 75 beats/min and an arterial pressure 120/80 mmHg. Because epidural catheter was already inserted, it was decided to proceed with the operation under epidural anesthesia. After placing the patient in the supine position with a left lateral tilt, a 20-gauge catheter was inserted at left radial artery after modified Allen's test for direct arterial pressure monitoring. A 16-gauge peripheral line was inserted and Hartmann's solution 600 ml was administered. Oxygen was administered via a face mask. After a negative aspiration test, 2% lidocaine 20 ml plus fentanyl 100 µg was injected through the epidural catheter. Ten minutes after the epidural injection, she had a heart rate and arterial pressure of 74 beats/min and 89/54 mmHg, respectively. Accordingly, ephedrine 5 mg was injected with rapid fluid administration. The anesthetic level was T5 to light touch with an alcohol sponge at 15 minutes after the epidural injection, and a cesarean section proceeded rapidly without complications. A male infant was delivered with a 1 and 5 minutes Apgar score of 7 and 9. The baby was ventilated manually with a bag and a mask due to cyanosis, and transferred to the neonatal ICU. He weighed 3,510 g and showed mild cardiomegaly and a ductal aneurysm on the echocardiographic examination. Over a 2-day admission, the baby showed a normal muscle tone and respiratory pattern. After delivery 10 units oxytocin was infused with fluids. The decrease in heart rate and blood pressure to 50 beats/min and 76/40 mmHg, respectively, was treated with rapid fluids administration, intravenous glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and ephedrine 5 mg intravenously three times. She complained of dizziness that disappeared after normalizing the blood pressure. The total operation time was 80 minutes and 1,900 ml of Hartmann's solution was infused. Epidural PCA with 0.15% ropivacaine plus fentanyl was connected for postoperative pain control. The patient did not show any changes in their vital signs or syncopal attack at recovery room over a 60 minutes observation period and was transferred to the general ward.",1.65,92.0,33.79
18946,"Patient 1 was a 50-year-old woman (height 1.55 m, weight 82 kg, BMI 34.1 kg m-2) with severe steroid-dependent allergic asthma who demonstrated no therapeutic response to omalizumab. The patient had never smoked. Disease onset had occurred in early childhood, with remission from age 15–25. The patient had a history of severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy, despite regular treatment with high-dose oral and inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. In August 2015, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration and received a single dose of autologous BMMCs intravenously. Measured variables were performed before treatment and periodically up to 1 year after BMMC transplantation (Table ). Whole-body 99mTc-BMMC scintigraphy was performed 2 h after administration and demonstrated a normal biodistribution of labeled cells, with greater uptake in the liver, lungs (especially the right), heart, blood pool, kidneys, and bladder (Fig. ). Over the following days, the patient experienced improvement of respiratory symptoms but developed sinus tachycardia, requiring a reduction in LABA dose. A mild increase in ventilation of all zones of the right lung was also observed 120 days after BMMC transplantation. Asthma control was successfully achieved with half of the prior dose of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA for up to 12 months after BMMC transplantation. Self-perceived QoL score significantly improved on day 7 after the procedure and remained steady over 1 year of follow-up (Fig. ). Lung function and 6MWD measurements remained stable throughout.",1.55,82.0,34.13
117197,"A female patient aged 13 visited Bucheon St Mary's Hospital Emergency Department for seizures. She showed symptoms of fever (40℃), vomiting, and hypoglycemia, with a serum glucose level of 58 mg/dL. We conducted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain a differential diagnosis of abnormalities in the central nervous system. The MRI results showed ectopic neurohypophysis and an invisible pituitary stalk, which were consistent with PSIS (). We transferred her to the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology to test pituitary functions.\nThe patient was born at our hospital by cesarean section at 42 weeks and 1 day of gestation, with a birth weight of 3.56 kg (10th–50th percentile). She showed signs of lethargy 2 days after birth, and was found to have hypoglycemia on blood sugar test (21 mg/dL). The patient was thus admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 14 days. She underwent a transfusion therapy, and her blood sugar stabilized before discharge. During her hospital stay, only a thyroid function test was conducted for endocrinologic evaluation, the results of which were within the normal range. Follow-up observation did not continue afterward, and medical records for the first 13 years of her life could not be obtained. According to her parents, the patient received Emergency Treatment for febrile seizures and hypoglycemia many times at other hospitals until the age of 6. Her motor and language development was normal although her school academic performance was poor. No particular disease was of note in the patient's family history, and she had a younger brother. Her father's height was 170 cm; her mother's height was 160 cm; her midparental height was 158.5 cm.\nOn physical examination, the patient's height was 160 cm (75th–90th percentile), and she weighed 53 kg (50th–75th percentile), with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.45 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile) (). The sexual maturity rate (SMR) was Tanner breast I and pubic hair I. Radiography of the left hand revealed a bone age of 12 years. Her routine laboratory evaluation showed total cholesterol level of 207.1 mg/dL (normal range for age, <170 mg/dL), increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol level of 155 mg/dL (normal range for age, <110 mg/dL), increased triglyceride of 156 mg/dL (normal range for age, <90 mg/dL), and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level of 38 mg/dL (normal range for age, >45 mg/dL) ().\nThe patient underwent basal and dynamic endocrine investigation (). The results showed inadequate GH and cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (peak GH, 0.08 µg/L [normal limit, >10 µg/L]; peak cortisol, 3.28 µg/dL [normal limit, >22 µg/dL]) consistent with the diagnosis GHD and adrenocortical insufficiency. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were also decreased at 5.31 ng/mL (normal range for age, 247–396 ng/mL) and 1,167.87 ng/mL (normal range for age, 1,527–4,418 ng/mL), respectively. LH and FSH levels rose to 1.58 IU/L and 1.16 IU/L, respectively, following stimulation with GnRH. These findings were consistent with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. TSH showed no response to TRH; regarding prolactin, the basal level was elevated at 64 ng/mL (normal level, 3–24 ng/mL) and the level increased further to 157 ng/mL upon TRH simulation. Based on these results, we diagnosed the patient as CPHD caused by PSIS, prescribed cortisol, thyroid hormone, and estrogen, and followed her up in our outpatient clinic.\nHowever, the patient showed poor compliance, and appropriate treatment could not be continued. She visited again as an outpatient 2 years later at the age of 15 years. For 2 years, she grew in height by 7 cm (167 cm; 95th–97th percentile) and in weight by 7 kg (60 kg; 75th–90th percentile). The patient's BMI was 21.3 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile), and the patient had truncal obesity. SMR was Tanner breast I and pubic hair I and her bone age was 14. CPHD was also confirmed on the combined pituitary function test conducted again. In addition, a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test revealed normal glucose tolerance and normal insulin level. Bone density showed osteoporosis (T-score of -3.3). Similar to the prior examination results, there were increases in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol.\nThe patient started the cortisol (hydrocortisone 10 mg AM and 5 mg PM), thyroid hormone (levothyroxine, 50 µg/day), and estrogen (conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/day) replacement therapy again. Patient and parent education was provided to increase her compliance to treatment. The patient reached her final adult height (168 cm) at the age of 16, which was 9.5 cm taller than the midparental height, 158.5 cm ().",1.67,60.0,21.51
54908,"A 68-year-old woman (body weight, 48 kg; height, 158 cm) was referred to our emergency department for acute-onset chest and back pain. On arrival, her vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate, 17 breaths/min; temperature, 36.4 °C; blood pressure, 94/56 mmHg; heart rate, 73 beats/min; oxygen saturation level, 99% in ambient air; and Glasgow Coma Scale score 15. Physical examination revealed no heart murmur and normal respiratory sounds. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Her medical history included Stanford type B aortic dissection, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis controlled with anti-rheumatic drugs and alternate-day oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 5 mg per dose). Computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosed AAD from the aortic root to the renal arteries, no aortic rupture, and no malperfusion. The ascending aortic maximum short diameter was 39 mm, and the maximum thickness of the thrombosed false lumen was 4 mm (Fig. ). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed no evidence of cardiac tamponade, aortic valve insufficiency, or other significant valve diseases. Her vital signs were stable; therefore, an urgent operation at a later date for AAD was planned. Preoperative blood pressure control was performed in our intensive care unit, in combination with bed rest, to prevent recurrent aortic events. Her systolic blood pressure was maintained between 90 and 110 mmHg with continuous infusion of a calcium antagonist (nicardipine 0.3–1.2 µg/kg/min). Her heart rate was between 80 and 100 beats/min, and oxygen saturation was 98% at 2 l/min oxygenation with a nasal cannula.\nA day after the onset of aortic dissection, cardiac auscultation revealed a Levine 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex with no diastolic component. Subsequent investigation using TTE led to the detection of SAM of the mitral valve. TTE revealed LV hypovolemia, LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction due to SAM without LV hypertrophy (LVH), and interventricular septal (IVS) bulging due to a narrow aorto-mitral angle of 106.4° (Fig. a, b). The basal IVS thickness was 18.1 mm. The LV wall motion was hyperkinetic, with an ejection fraction of 81.7%. The peak flow velocity in the LVOT was 6.25 m/s. Abnormal laboratory data included hyponatremia (serum Na: 115.9 mEq/l), and her urine output per day was approximately 3000 ml. An adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test revealed suspected relative adrenal failure due to physical stress after acute aortic dissection. The systolic heart murmur due to SAM tended to improve with heart rate control to between 60 and 70 beats/min with beta-blocker therapy (landiolol hydrochloride 2 µg/kg/min) and infusion load.\nThe aortic false lumen was still thrombosed, but the ascending aortic maximum short diameter was dilated from 39 to 45 mm and the maximum thickness of the thrombosed false lumen increased from 4 to 8 mm in the preoperative CT scan at 14 days after the onset of aortic dissection. In case of postoperative unstable hemodynamics following the physical stressful aortic repair, concomitant IVSM during the ascending aortic replacement was planned for the prevention of SAM. The patient’s adrenal insufficiency recovered gradually with alternate-day oral corticosteroid (prednisolone 5 mg per dose); therefore, we performed the operation 19 days after the onset of aortic dissection. In the operating room, transesophageal echocardiography under total anesthesia still showed SAM. Following median sternotomy, IVSM and ascending aortic replacement with a one-branched J Graft Shield Neo 26-mm Dacron graft (Japan Lifeline Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were performed under usual cardiopulmonary bypass with cannulation via the right femoral artery and right atrium. In the operative findings, there was no pericardial effusion that could compress the LV structure. During the IVSM procedure, the needle stick technique (NST) (Fig. a, b) was applied because of easy, quick, and protective exposure to the IVS muscle to be resected. Briefly, three 21-gauge needles were inserted into the interventricular septum just below the aortic valve annulus beyond the far side of the septal bulge. One needle was inserted beneath the mid portion of the right coronary cusp to provide a right-side margin, the second was inserted beneath the commissure of the right and left coronary cusps to provide a left-side margin, and the last was inserted between the previous two as a guide for the thickness of the myectomy (Fig. a). The resected muscle weighed 278 mg in total (Fig. c). The cardiopulmonary bypass was easily weaned. Postoperative TTE showed improved systolic flow velocity in the LVOT of 0.93 m/sec and no evidence of SAM (Fig. a, b). The patient was discharged from our hospital 22 days after the operation, with no major complications.",1.58,48.0,19.23
14998,"A 38-year-old man, 166 cm in height and 62 kg in weight, with type I neurofibromatosis presented with pain associated with a large mass in the upper back region. He reported that the mass had been growing gradually since being excised 8 years prior. One day before the current admission, pain had begun to emanate from the mass, which had gradually increased to 7 cm in diameter. Its visible diameter on the surface reportedly kept increasing, and it was 15 cm at the time of the current admission. Preoperative enhanced chest computed tomography revealed a huge mass of 28 cm in width and 8 cm in height (Fig. ).\nOn physical examination, the mass was hard and exhibited heat and tenderness on palpation. Pain from the mass prevented the patient from lying supine, but neck motion was not restricted. Complete blood cell count on admission revealed hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, platelet count 255,000/μL, and leukocyte count 11,500/μL. These parameters had abruptly changed to hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL, platelet count 135,000/μL, and leukocyte count 16,700/μL by 21 hours after admission, and his respective systole, diastole, and heart rate had changed from 120/70 mmHg and 78 beats/min to 130/80 mmHg and 160 beats/min. Due to suspected active bleeding from the mass, emergent evacuation of the hematoma was planned.\nThe patient was admitted to the operating theater in right LDP. A pad was placed beside the right side of his head to maintain it in a neutral position. Electrocardiography and pulse oximetry were continuously monitored. The right radial artery was catheterized under ultrasound guidance for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and frequent arterial blood sampling. During catheterization, the patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen, and a non-inflatable LMA (size 4 i-gelTM, Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) was prepared by lubricating the back, side, and front of the cuff with its orifice spared.\nAnesthesia was then induced via 70 mg ketamine and 3 mg midazolam. In conjunction with the loss of consciousness 70 mg rocuronium was administered to facilitate the insertion of the prepared LMA, and the patient was manually ventilated via a mask. After the train of four count became 0, the LMA was inserted into the laryngopharynx. During its insertion an assistant placed the patient's head in the sniffing position with the head extended and the neck flexed. The anesthesiologist gently introduced the LMA downwards and backwards along the hard palate until resistance against insertion was encountered (Fig. ). After the LMA was inserted the patient was manually ventilated to confirm appropriate placement of the LMA based on detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide from the exhaled gas via capnography. The position of the LMA was secured by taping its integral bite block to the facial skin. The lungs were mechanically ventilated with 50% oxygen. The tidal volume and respiratory rate were adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration between 35 and 40 mmHg and a peak airway pressure below 20 cm H2O. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to maintain state entropy values between 40 and 60.\nAt the conclusion of the LMA insertion the patient was placed in a supine position. Pads and pillows were placed behind the head and the body trunk below the mass in order that the mass not be compressed while he was in the supine position (Fig. ). After the LMA was removed from the mouth, the trachea was intubated with a 7.5-mm internal diameter cuffed reinforced endotracheal tube using a portable videolaryngoscope (UEscope, UE Medical Devices Inc., Newton, MA). The capnographic waveform confirmed the placement of the tube into the airway. Auscultation of breath sounds in both lungs ruled out endobronchial placement of the tube. Mechanical ventilation was maintained as described above. Under ultrasound guidance the right internal jugular vein was catheterized to administer blood products and fluids and to monitor central venous pressure continuously. The patient was then placed in a prone position with the head turned to the left (Fig. ).\nThe dependent eye was protected from external compression. Arms were not abducted greater than 90°. Every pressure point was padded. Endotracheal tube positioning, adequate ventilation, and patency of the arterial and venous lines were reassessed after instigation of the prone position. The surgery took 100 minutes. During the surgery the patient received 900 mL of packed red blood cells, 640 mL of fresh frozen plasma, 2890 mL of plasmalyte, and 50 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 to compensate for blood loss. He was also administered 10 mg ephedrine, 20 μg norepinephrine, and 600 mg CaCl2. At the end of the surgery the patient could be placed in a supine position and the neuromuscular blockade maintained by a total of 100 mg rocuronium was reversed via 200 mg sugammadex.\nAfter recovery of spontaneous breathing and consciousness, the endotracheal tube was withdrawn uneventfully. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. On the first postoperative day, he was discharged to the general ward and was satisfied with the results of the surgery (Fig. ). The remnant mass was excised 1 month after the surgery, and at that time-point, the patient had experienced no complications related to the preceding above-described surgery. The patient has provided informed consent for the publication of this case report.",1.66,62.0,22.5
94885,"The 58 year-old Turkish male patient was 82 kg and 174 cm high. The case was due to be operated on with the diagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia.\nAccording to the physical examination, on the whole body of the case were various epidemic, indolent neurofibromatosis nodules of different sizes [Figure and ]. It was also understood during physical examination that the case had pectus carinatum deformity in the thorax zone [Figure ].\nOn the other hand, according to patient's history, it was observed that the case had also had TMD (more apparent in the left temporomandibular joint) for about five years. Particularly, the case was complaining of sharp aches originating from the right pre-auricular zone and advancing towards the eye of the same side as well as periorbital and temporal areas. Another complaint of the case was the clicking sound that occured while chewing. Indeed, mouth-opening was seen to be a fingerbreadth (approximately 1.35 cm) during the physical examination, therefore mallampati score could not be assessed [Figure ]. It was learned that the case had not accepted to have an operation due to his phobia although he was advised to have one for his TMD.\nIn preoperative laboratory assessment, apart from a slight leucocytosis (9.2 × 109/L) and increased CRP (11.6 mg/dl), no other pathologies were observed. And in the electrocardiographic examination, an incomplete right branch block was found to be present.\nWhen evaluated in the pre-operative visit, it was thought that regional anaesthesia application would be more appropriate for the patient and in order to exclude neurofibromatosis' central nervous system involvement, the case was applied a cranial and spinal MRI examination. No pathological findings were encountered in the MRI examination.\nConsidering the risks that may be caused by the available disturbances of the case (especially, the possibility of difficult and even unsuccessful intubation and the risk of failure in providing a secure airway), it was decided to apply spinal anesthesia on the case.\nThe patient, intravenously premedicated with midazolam 1.5 mg was monitored with electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry (SPO2) at the operating theatre. After administration of 500 mL lactated Ringer's solution; spinal anesthesia was successfully performed in the sitting position between lumbar 4 and 5 intervertebral spaces with a 27-gauge atraumatic spinal needle with 3 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. The level of the sensorial block was on thoracal 7, the operation was started in the 7th minute.\nBesides, in consideration of unsuccessful anaesthesia or failure or the risk of a compulsion to turn back to general anaesthesia during the operation, an ear nose and throat specialist experienced in the subject of tracheostomy, a tracheostomy kit and sterile surgical tools were kept available in the operating theatre during the operation.\nThe patient tolerated the surgery very well without additional hypnotics. The duration of the uneventful surgery was 1 hour. All haemodynamic values were stable during surgery. The case that had been post-operatively observed in the intense care unit for one day was transferred to the surgical clinic without any complications observed. No postoperative complications were observed and he was discharged from the hospital on the 3rd post-operative day.\nAccording to the monitoring carried out until the day of discharge, no complications such as headache, nausea, blood pressure change (especially hypotension) and neurological deficit that may develop secondary to spinal anesthesia were observed.",1.74,82.0,27.08
73931,"A physically healthy 10-year-old boy, who weighed 32 kg (just below 50 percentile) at a height of 1.34 m (just above 50 percentile), noticed sudden atraumatic left foot deformity on waking up in the morning. There was no relevant past medical history. A visit to a local doctor was arranged promptly, and he was referred to our department for further examination and treatment within 2 days.\nOn physical examination, there was slight tenderness and swelling over the dorsal aspect of the left midfoot. The left forefoot was rigid and held in an equinovarus position (). Almost all of the load was transmitted through the lateral border of the left foot. Muscle strength was intact in the left toe extensors and flexors, and there was no sensory disturbance over his left foot. Abnormal body movements, such as tremor, clonus, tics, or dystonia, were not detected. Plain radiographs showed inversion of the left forefoot (Figures and ), suggesting incongruity of the Chopart joint complex (), which was confirmed by CT (). He was then referred to the Department of Clinical Neuroscience in our hospital. Blood laboratory results were within normal limits, and magnetic resonance images of the brain revealed no organic abnormality. There was no evidence of neurological disorder on clinical examination.\nDetailed history taking revealed that the boy had been under psychological stress. He had been playing baseball but was doing so reluctantly to please his mother. He wanted to tell his mother and the baseball team coach of his wish to quit baseball but felt unable to do so. Furthermore, his parents were divorced, and his father had remarried and started a second family. Considering all the events in his social history, we concluded his foot deformity was psychogenic equinovarus accompanied by CD. Therefore, we opted for conservative treatment rather than surgical reduction under general anesthesia.\nWhen the boy woke up on the morning after visiting our hospital, the left rigid equinovarus deformity had disappeared. However, it returned 2 days later, and then resolved completely after another 2 days. Subsequently, the clinical course was uneventful, with no return of the fixed deformity after he was allowed to quit playing baseball. He continues to have no pain or discomfort in his left foot and has no limitations on physical activity.",1.34,32.0,17.82
142272,"A 25-year-old Korean woman was referred by a general physician with a 7-month history of uncontrolled hypertension. Her past me-dical and family histories were otherwise non-contributory. On admission, she was 165 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination was unremarkable except for high blood pressure of 182/115 mm Hg. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and minimal pro-teinuria. Laboratory examination results were within normal limits, except for an increase in plasma renin activity (>20 ng/mL/hr, normal range: supine, 0.5-1.9 ng/mL/hr; erect, 1.9-6.0 ng/mL/hr), plasma aldosterone (668.21 pg/mL, normal range: supine, 10-105 pg/mL; erect, 34-273 pg/mL) and angiotensin II (90 pg/mL, normal range: 9-47 pg/mL). Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which was confirmed as mild LVH on echocardiography. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated compression of the LRV between the aorta and SMA with pelvic congestion syndrome (). An adrenal tumor was not detected, and both renal arteries were intact. Renal scintigraphic findings using technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, with and without captopril challenge, were normal. Selective renal venography demonstrated stenosis of the LRV at the level of the aorta, with dilatation of the left ovarian vein and multiple collateral veins with contrast filling the pelvic cavity (). The pressure gradient between the LRV and the inferior vena cava was 8 mm Hg (normal <3 mm Hg). Plasma renin activity in the LRV was almost five times higher than that in the right renal vein (5.88 ng/mL/hr vs. 1.17 ng/mL/hr). Hypertension did not respond to calcium channel antagonist and beta adrenergic blocker, but, the blood pressure decreased to 110/65 mm Hg after administration of angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan (16 mg/d). The patient has not suffered from hypertension for more than 2 years with the use of this medication.",1.65,53.0,19.47
