2011,1.8,180.0 cm,74.9,74.9 kg,23.12,80.4,"d=4210, d_ctx=49","was 7 before SAH.\nOn physical examination, the patient was 180 centimeters tall and weighed 82.6 kg with blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, pulse 76/min, and respiratory rate 19 breaths/min with an O2 saturation (Spo2) of 88% on room air and 97% on 1 L of oxygen per minute. Cardiovascular examination was normal, the lungs were clear on auscultation, and abdominal examination was unremarkable. On neurological examination, he was alert with a MMSE score of 28. Eye movements were normal. There was mild narrowing of right palpebral fissure and a constricted pupil with preserved light reflex of the right eye. There was mild arm and hand paresis and moderate leg paresis on the right side. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk on the right side. The Babinski reflex on the right side was extensor. The right arm was ataxic, but the presence of ataxia was unequivocal in the right leg due to moderate paresis. Superficial sensation on the left side, including the face, was decreased, and deep sensation was preserved. The patient could not sit up or maintain a sitting posture and had bladder and bowel dysfunction.\nInitial investigations revealed slight anemia (hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL, mean cell volume: 94 μm3), hypoalbuminemia (3.5 g/dL), and low-density to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (26 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia and hypercapnia (PaO2: 49.5 mm Hg, PaCO2: 73.4 mm Hg on room air and PaO2: 111.0 mm Hg, PaCO2: 77.7 mm Hg on 1 L of oxygen per minute). Other blood tests, including inflammatory markers (C reactive protein: 0.3 mg/dL), were normal. Respiratory function test results were vital capacity (VC) 3,022 mL, %VC 73%, forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1.0) 2,540 mL, and FEV1.0% 78%.\nHead magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted MRI) revealed a focal high-intensity area in the dorsolateral medulla oblongata and the upper cervical cord on the right side (Figure ).\nThoracic computed tomography (CT) was normal.\nNeurological examination and MRI showed lateral medullary syndrome with ipsilateral palsy.\nThrough physical and occupational therapy, he gradually developed his physical strength. The right leg paresis recovered from a moderate to slight degree of impairment, and the presence of ataxia became apparent.\nWe evaluated his swallowing ability by videofluorography and videoendoscopy. Videofluorography showed that relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), especially on the right (ipsilateral) side, was insufficient. Barium jellies hardly passed the UES with passage of small amounts along the left (contralateral) side, and after several swallowing actions, aspiration into the trachea occurred. Videoendoscopy showed insufficient movement of the right vocal cord. We conducted dysphagia rehabilitation. However, improvement was limited, and gastrostomy tube was installed. He received combined cricopharyngeal myotomy and laryngeal elevation 1 year and 7 months after SAH onset. After surgery, swallowing ability improved. Finally, he could take almost all nutrition orally in an upright sitting position.\nWe removed the speech cannula soon after admission. We observed his respiratory condition, and it was expected to improve. However, blood gas analysis did not ameliorate and PaCO2 began to worsen. Nine months after SAH onset, PaCO2 became 90.3 mm Hg without the presence of respiratory infection. Portable polysomnography (PSG) showed that consecutive apnea-hypopnea indices (AHIs) were 48.6 and 63.0/h. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP) was tried under various conditions, and an appropriate condition was eventually found. He received nasal bilevel PAP under the condition of spontaneous timed (ST) mode (IPAP of 8 cm H2O, EPAP of 4 cm H2O, and backup breathing frequency of 12/min) during the night. His nocturnal SpO2 dramatically improved under this condition. Blood gas analysis during the daytime also improved (PaO2: 92.9 mm Hg and PaCO2: 54.7 mm Hg on 1 L of oxygen per minute) (Figure ).\nHe was eventually discharged home 2 years and 2 months after SAH onset. Then, he needed no oxygen supply (PaO2: 75.4 mm Hg and PaCO2: 50.6 mm Hg on room air). His weight decreased to 74.9 kg at the time of discharge. However, it recovered to 80.3 kg "

Thyroid function laboratory tests showed hyperthyroidism: Elevated free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels, at 2.75 ng/dL (normal value [n.v.]: 0.7–1.48), and 4.10 pg/mL (n.v.: 1.71–3.71), respectively; and suppressed and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, at 0.0001 µUI/mL (n.v.: 0.350–4.940). A thyroid ultrasound showed a significantly increased glandular size for age. The total volume (approximately 17.1 mL, with a right lobe of approximately 8.8 mL and a left lobe of approximately 8.3 mL) turned out to be quadrupled with respect to the age reference value: 3.1 mL +/− 1.05 mL; ultrasound also showed hypoechoic and diffusely inhomogeneous echo-structure and intensely increased vascularization of the gland.\nOphthalmologic evaluation confirmed the presence of exophthalmos and the absence of lagophthalmos or visual acuity deficiency, with normal ocular motility, slight congestion of the eyelids (non-inflammatory oedema), and modest bulbar conjunctival hyperaemia. No diplopia was observed. The exophthalmometry detected a value of 17.00 mm for the right eye and a value of 17.5 mm for the left eye. Clinical Activity Score (CAS) was 6 and NOSPECS was IVa. These findings, combined with clinical conditions and TSH receptor antibody positivity, led to a diagnosis of Graves’ disease. Anti-peroxidase and anti-tireoglobulin antibodies were also found to be positive. Therefore, methimazole was administered at the starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day in two administrations, confirming that blood count and liver function were in the normal range. During hospitalization, the clinical conditions of the young patient improved, and the patient was discharged.\nAfter one month, when the patient returned to our clinic, weight increased from 24.4 kg to 26.5 kg, while the BMI remained under the 3rd percentile, with a value of 13.10. Blood count, liver function, albumin, and total protein, checked to assess possible adverse effects of the methimazole therapy, were normal. Thyroid function improved: FT3 was 7.32 pg/mL, FT4 was 1.65 ng/dL, and TSH was 0.005 µUI/mL. Clinical examination showed good clinical conditions and bilateral exophthalmos, greater on the right eye. CAS was 7 and NOSPECS was again IVa. The heart rate was 88 beats per minute. During the follow-up visits, at two and three months after discharge, blood count and liver function were also normal, thyroid function improved, and thyroid volume decreased; thus, the therapy was reduced to 0.27 mg/kg/day.\nAfter four months, thyroid function clearly improved: FT3 of 3.53 pg/mL, FT4 of 1.17 ng/dL, and TSH of 0.007 µUI/mL. Blood count and liver function were in the normal range, but the eye examination showed worsening of the ophthalmopathy, with the following signs of activity: Increase in the exophthalmos of the right eye with palpebral retraction, soft tissue involvement (succulent eyelids with associated oedema, caruncular and conjunctival hyperaemia, and oedema) and keratopathy resulting from exposure. CAS was 9 and NOSPECS Va. On the basis of the ocular findings, steroid therapy was initiated by oral administration of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for four weeks, and then gradually tapered. Thyroid function improved again; five months after discharge, thyroid hormones remained in the normal range: FT3 was 2.450 pg/mL, FT4 was 0.97 ng/dL, and TSH increased to 0.127 µUI/mL. A clinical examination showed a reduced thyroid volume, which was confirmed by the thyroid ultrasound that showed dimensions of 13 mL (17.1 mL at previous control) and reduced echogenicity, with non-homogeneous eco-structure, and increased vascularization of the left lobe. Therefore, therapy with methimazole was further reduced to 0.18 mg/kg/day. Thyroid function was normal, with an FT3 value of 3.59 pg/mL (n.v.: 2–4.4), and an FT4 value of 1.49 ng/dL (n.v.: 0.90–1.70), although TSH was slightly reduced with a value of 0.182 µUI/mL (n.v.: 0.270–4.200). Blood count and liver function remained normal, so therapy with methimazole was confirmed. At the last clinical follow-up, after eight months, thyroid function remained good, the exophthalmos was reduced and the patient did not have tremors.

His conjunctiva was not icteric but slightly anemic. On chest examination, his heart rhythm was regular with no murmur, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. His abdomen was soft, not distended, and not tender. A soft and movable mass was palpable around the epigastrium. The legs and feet showed no edema. Laboratory tests showed a creatinine level of 0.89 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen level of 12.6 mg/dl, total bilirubin level of 0.3 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase level of 17 IU/L, and alanine transaminase level of 19 IU/L. The patient’s white blood cell count was 8930 per cubic milliliter, hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dl, and platelet count was 438,000 per cubic milliliter. An esophagogastric fiber (EGF) showed type 3 gastric carcinoma in the antrum. The tumor caused pyloric stenosis and invasion to the duodenum, so the patient was admitted to the hospital (Fig. a–c). Staging laparoscopy was performed to assess the extent of tumor spread, and laparoscopic bypass was performed. Staging laparoscopy revealed peritoneal dissemination, and peritoneal lavage cytology revealed tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. We diagnosed L, type 3, circ, cT4a(SE), cNx, pP1, pCY1, M0, stage IV (the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma). The patient was initially treated with docetaxel 40 mg/m2 on day 1, cisplatin (CDDP) 60 mg/m2 on day 1, and TS-1 120 mg/day on days 1–14, followed by a 2-week recovery period (DCS regimen). Dexamethasone 9.9 mg and palonosetron 0.75 mg were administered on day 1, and dexamethasone 6.6 mg was administered on days 2 and 3 as premedication. The patient had grade 3 diarrhea (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria) after one course (Fig. a, b). Then TS-1 was reduced (100 mg). After two courses of the DCS regimen, EGF and computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor had shrunk (Fig. c–e), and then staging laparoscopy was performed to evaluate a response. Peritoneal dissemination disappeared, and peritoneal lavage cytology revealed no tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. Then salvage operation, laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ dissection, was performed. Pathological findings were ypT2(MP), ypN2(3/15), ypP0, ypCY0, M0, ystage II (Fig. ). TS-1100 mg/day on days 1–14, every 3 weeks was started as adjuvant chemotherapy. After 15 months, CT revealed multiple peritoneal nodules (Fig. a). They were highly suspected as a recurrence. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 was started as a second regimen. Dexamethasone 6.6 mg, famotidine 20 mg, and granisetron 3 mg were administered on days 1, 8, and 15 as premedication. This regimen achieved partial response (Fig. b), but its efficacy did not last. After 3 months, CT revealed progressive disease (Fig. c). The original gastric carcinoma was HER2-positive (Fig. ). The patient’s Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 2; his body weight was 50.7 kg; and he complained of appetite loss. We concluded that the "

Rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood investigations were within normal range. X-ray abdomen revealed few dilated bowel loops, paucity of distal gas shadows and nasogastric tube in the right upper quadrant of abdomen (). Ultrasound abdomen revealed liver predominantly on the left side of abdomen, multiple spleen like structures on the right side with distended bowel loops. Echocardiography revealed ostium secundum atrial septal defect of 5 mm with levocardia.\nSince pre-operative diagnosis of abdominal situs inversus was known, a left upper quadrant transverse incision was given in contrast to the classical right upper quadrant transverse incision. Laparotomy confirmed situs inversus abdominis with the liver and duodenal C loop on the left side (a). The baby had three spleens on the right side (b). The proximal jejunum was massively dilated and there were multiple jejunal atresias (5 in number) starting from about 45 cm from the duodenojejunal flexure (a). The entire distal small bowel was supplied by a single branch of the ileo-colic artery and had apple peel appearance. There were several Ladd’s bands crossing the second part of duodenum with narrow base mesentery.

Since the patient developed neutropenia during the chemotherapy, reduced doses of anthracyclines were administered for the last three cycles: 5-fluorouracil (600 mg), epirubicin (110 mg) and cyclophosphamide (dosage 600 mg). The chemotherapy lasted for 5 months in 2010–2011, followed by radiotherapy to the breast tissue (50Gy) and boost to the operation scar (10Gy) for two months in 2011. The patient developed amenorrhea shortly after the initiation of chemotherapy. However, no hormonal tests are available to the authors as they were made in another hospital.\nAfter chemo- and radiotherapy-induced amenorrhea, the patient regained rare spontaneous menstrual cycles at the beginning of 2012. Her FSH level was 22,1 U/L and AMH level was 0,04 ng/mL. Despite of the irregular oligomenorrhea, a spontaneous ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed in the right fallopian tube in the same year. After removing the ectopic pregnancy, the irregular oligomenorrhea lasted until 2013, indicating the deterioration of the ovarian follicular pool after cancer treatment. This was considered as a strong indication for using the ovarian tissue grafting to obtain the pregnancy, when the patient was subsequently counselled for her wish for motherhood.\nThe decision to use the heterotopic ovarian transplantation was based on the patient’s clinical conditions, what prevented the ovarian tissue orthotopic transplantation. Briefly, recurrent laparoscopies had revealed several pelvic pathologies: before and after cancer therapy, recurrent cystic benign ovarian tumours were found, arising from the left ovary. The tumour completely filled the rectouterine pouch (cavum Douglas) and dislocated the uterus to the right. In addition, mild endometriosis and several abdominal adhesions were diagnosed between the intestines, uterus and tumour tissue. Since the patient had also a spontaneous ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube, likely damaging the tissue, the heterotopic ovarian tissue transplantation was the only option to restore her fertility.\nThawing of five ovarian cortical pieces was performed using the following steps: the cryovials were placed in the 30 °C water bath until the ice was melted. Then the pieces of cortical strips were incubated in 1 M PrOH and 0.2 M sucrose for 5 min and followed by 0.5 M PrOH and 0.2 M sucrose for 5 min in room temperature. Thereafter the pieces were placed into 0.2 M sucrose in HSA (25 mg/ml) in PBS for 10 min. Heterotopic transplantation was used for thawed pieces of ovarian cortex into a submuscular pocket on the left side of the lateral pelvic wall and marked with a metallic marker for better ultrasound visibility (as shown in Fig. ).\nAfter the ovarian tissue transplantation, during the following three months, the FSH level declined to 14,1 U/L and AMH level raised to 0,3 ng/mL. In the middle of 2013, the patient regained her first spontaneous menstrual cycle after tissue grafting.\nFor controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, we classified the patient as a possible poor ovarian responder, and used the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist long protocol with Diphereline (3.75 mg) administration started on the 21st cycle day. On the third day after the beginning of bleeding"

At 10 months, he exhibited poor head control, choreoathetoid distal limb movements associated with increased extensor tone and brisk reflexes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at this time revealed partial agenesis of corpus callosum and under-development of the frontal and parietal temporal regions, while extensive investigation for an underlying metabolic disorder, including measurement of mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, serum copper level, white cell enzymes, very long chain fatty acids, carnitine levels, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and urine organic acid, failed to detect any abnormalities. Karyotyping and echocardiogram were normal too, while blood and CSF lactate showed borderline values (2.8 mmol/l; 2.7 mmol/l, respectively, normal values < 2.1 mmol/l). Histochemical and biochemical analyses of skeletal muscle were unremarkable, with the exception of a mild increase in lipid content in electron microscope images. Motor milestones were subsequently delayed: he rolled at 18 months, crawled at 48 months and could only walk a short distance unaided at 9 years of age. His mobility performance was further compromised by the development of hip dysplasia at 11 years, for which surgery was required at 16 years, following which mobility was reduced to a wheelchair. In the meantime, when he was 10 years old, he was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and required hydrocortisone replacement. Since this time, the clinical course has been progressive, with gradual worsening of muscle fatigue and weakness and dysphagia.

Labs were ordered and showed the following: Red blood cell count of 4.6 1012/L, white blood cell count of 6.1 109/L, a hemoglobin level of 115 g/L, and platelet level of 227 109/L.\nEarlier that year, the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of generalized abdominal pain and was found to have a splenoportovenous thrombosis. Subsequently, the patient was referred and started following up with the hematology clinic. A follow up CT showed an incidental finding of a left subphrenic focal pouch measuring 3.5 cm with air fluid level. Since the patient was asymptomatic at that time, no intervention was proposed. A later CT was done () and showed an increase in size in comparison to the previous study, with air-fluid level associated with stable left diaphragmatic and pleural thickening, with subsequent linear adjacent basal lung atelectasis.\nTo further define the extent of the leak, an X-ray fluoroscopy barium meal () was done and confirmed a leak from the proximal gastric pouch with no communication to the pleural space. Percutaneous drainage was placed by interventional radiology (IR) which showed bloody flanks with thick pus. The patient was discharged with a follow up in the clinic where he came later complaining of unresolving cough with undocumented fever.\nAn X-ray fluoro-fistulogram () showed the contrast from the left upper quadrant collection appears to be freely communicating with the left lower lobe bronchioles reaching into the left main bronchus and trachea. And the diagnosis of a gastrobronchial fistula was established.\nEndoscopic management was initially trialed. Nevertheless, stent placement was aborted during endoscopy due to the presence of esophageal varices. Instead, an over the scope clip (OTSC) was placed with no complication. Thereafter, the clip was unable to close the whole fistula. And surgery was indicated.\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine with legs apart. Surgery was performed by an attending and professor of upper gastrointestinal surgery with the assistance of an upper gastrointestinal surgery fellow. Laparoscopic approach was carried out through 5 ports. A 12 mm camera port placed supraumbilical, two 12 mm ports placed in the right and left lateral, a 5 mm port placed in the left anterior axillary line to retract the fat laterally away from the stomach, and a 5 mm port placed midline below the xiphoid process to be used as a liver retractor. The gastric tissue was exposed and was surrounded by adhesions. The adhesions were released using harmonic and hook diathermy to access the GBF site. A fistulojejunostomy was initially intended, but it wasn’t feasible due to inflamed and edematous fistula edges. Consequently, refashioning of the gastric fistula’s edges and invagination using a graham patch was done. Methylene blue test was negative. Then we proceeded with preforming a mini gastric bypass through the usual technique. Gastric pouch was 15 cm in length. After counting of the small bowel from duodenojejunal flexure 180 cm, gastrojejunostomy was done using linear 60 mm purple stapl"

Because it was slightly lower than the definition provided by Wallis [], we judged it as chylous ascites with a relatively low TG concentration. Initially, we reduced the NaCl and lipid content of the patient's diet to 5 g and 60 g per day, respectively, and continued treatment with furosemide and spironolactone, but we observed almost no decrease in ascetic fluid. Therefore, we stopped using medium-chain TGs (MCT) and reformulated the patient's diet to make it fat-restricted (1400 kcal, lipid 40 g per day) and added a single portion per day of Elental (300 kcal/80 g).\nElental was given orally and no side effects such as vomiting or diarrhea occurred.\nSeven days after the change in diet, the patient's body weight decreased from 58 to 54 kg and his abdominal circumference decreased from 88 to 84 cm "

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory examination showed hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose concentration, 157 mg/dL); elevated concentrations of HbA1c (10.3%), aspartate transaminase (38 IU/L), and alanine transaminase (46 IU/L); and a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (68.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). Furthermore, the patient had proteinuria (±), hematuria (+), and positive urinary ketone bodies (+) (Table ).\nHe did not have diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal abnormality, or a history of cardiovascular disease.\nA few days after his first visit, he was admitted to our hospital for the assessment and treatment of his T2DM. We found that his antibody titer to glutamic acid decarboxylase was undetectable (<5.0 U/mL). Additionally, his urinary C-peptide immunoreactivity excretion was well preserved at 96.5 µg/day, thus establishing a definitive diagnosis of T2DM. On the third day of hospitalization, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination revealed insulin resistance (Table ) [].\nAn electrocardiogram (Figure ) and chest radiograph (Figure ) revealed no abnormalities.\nAn abdominal ultrasound examination showed fatty liver (Figure -), right renal calcification (Figure , a white arrow), a gallbladder polyp (Figure , yellow arrows), and no abnormalities in the pancreas (Figure ).\nAbdominal computed tomography showed excess subcutaneous fat deposition (Figure , white arrows) and increased hepatic fat accumulation (Figure , yellow arrows) as assessed by the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio (Table ) [].\nHis clinical condition suggested the possibility of hereditary factors for T2DM, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, fatty liver, and insulin resistance with excess body weight and ectopic fat accumulation.\nBecause of the existing insulin resistance and the preserved capacity of intrinsic insulin secretion, the patient received lifestyle modification therapy during hospitalization. He was given printed information regarding the use of diet and exercise to treat T2DM. He also received an explanation of his present overweight condition and a target body weight of <70 kg. Instructions regarding dietary therapy were provided to the patient and his wife. On each day of hospitalization, the patient received managed hospital meals (1760 kcal/day based on 26 kcal/kg of ideal body weight; carbohydrates, 50%; protein, 1.2 g/kg; lipids, ≤300 mg/day cholesterol; non-saturated fatty acids, <10%; saturated fatty acids, <7%; no alcohol; and sodium chloride, 6 g/day). In-hospital exercise involved using treadmills and bicycle ergometers in the hospital exercise room and walking around the hospital. We provided instructions regarding moderate-intensity physical exercise, including resistance training, during each 30-minute session. After admission, his systolic blood pressure dropped to <100 mmHg. Therefore, we stopped all anti-hypertensive medications. He was initially treated with metformin (1000 mg/day) and subsequently with an additional SGLT2i (dapagliflozin at 5 mg/day), and his blood glucose concentration was well-controlled on the sixth day of hospitalization. After seven days of in-hospital therapy and education, the patient was discharged with the recommendation to continue appropriate dietary therapy (1760 kcal/day as described above) and at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. We explained that remission of T2DM would be possible after achieving an ideal body weight (<70 kg, which was his body weight at 20 years of age). The patient"

Radiography demonstrated open book pelvic fractures (Fig. a), and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination demonstrated free intraperitoneal fluid consistent with hemorrhage. He was transported emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy where bladder rupture was identified and pelvic packing was performed, but due to continued uncontained pelvic hemorrhage he was placed in a pelvic binder and brought to Interventional Radiology (IR). Via left RA, pelvic angiography was performed, and an actively extravasating left pudendal artery (Fig. b) was coil embolized; no other bleeding source was identified (Fig. c, d). Following sheath removal, patent hemostasis was achieved with a TR band. CT of the head, neck and torso was performed following the angioembolization. CT demonstrated intra- and extra-peritoneal contrast extravasation thought related to bladder injury, but did not show definitive active vascular extravasation.\nHowever, overnight he had continued hemodynamic instability and blood drainage through his negative pressure wound therapy device on his anterior abdominal wound, necessitating blood product replacement. Therefore, he was returned to IR for empiric embolization of the bilateral internal iliac arteries due to high level of suspicion for active pelvic bleeding prior to planned orthopedic pelvic stabilization surgery later that day.

He had a specialist review at the age of four months due to rapid growth in head circumference, demonstrating growth at two months to the 73rd percentile and further growth at four months to above the 97th percentile. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed at that time revealed no abnormalities or hydrocephalus. The patient’s father had a head circumference above the 97th percentile; therefore, this was put down to familial large head. At the age of eight months, he was noted to have delayed motor development (still requiring sitting support, no saving reaction, and not taking weight on his legs). At the age of 10 months, his body length was 71.3 cm (19th percentile) and weight was 9.26 kg (54th percentile). His height measurements charted over the years indicated a height growth below the 2.5th percentile from the age of six years onward (Figure ). However, his height growth velocity was normal, with progression along a particular percentile line throughout childhood and adolescence.\nExamination demonstrated a healthy young man with a weight of 51.5 kg and a height of 1.61 m (body mass index: 19.9 kg/m2). His height was below his expected final (mid-parental) height and below the 2.5th percentile.

Neurologically, the patient still had a pupillary reflex on the left with spontaneous eye movement and he had partial mouth opening and closing. The patient does not visibly respond to pain. No gag or corneal reflexes were noted by the ICU team or neurology.\nOver the last several years, the family was approached by the health care team on multiple occasions regarding consideration of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR). The family was told that the overall situation was hopeless due to his underlying primary disease. Despite this, the family always had hope that an ALS cure would be found and always wanted everything done.\nInitially, a 24 hr urine creatinine was collected (patient with indwelling foley catheter) and was 172 mg. This was repeated since the value was very low but still came back 199 mg of urinary creatinine in 24 hr. The coefficient of variation was 10%, and the average was 186 mg of urinary creatinine excreted in 24 hr (see for data summary). In addition, the patient's height was 185 cm.\nThe patient was treated successfully over several weeks i"

Due to exacerbation of inflammation, the patient temporarily needed a high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory control. On POD 20, however, the inflammation showed a trend toward improvement. Dark red drainage fluid was observed from the drainage tube anterior to the anastomosis, while endoscopy findings on POD 24 showed gastric ischemia and anastomotic failure (Fig. c and d). As CT showed no obvious abscess formation and peritonitis (Fig. c), local drainage was considered to have been controlled by the abdominal drainage tube and W-ED tube. The drainage volume from the anterior anastomotic drain tube was less than 5 ml/day and the drainage volume from the W-ED tube was 50–100 ml/day, which reduced the inflow of drainage to the anterior anastomotic drain side. Considering that the patient’s vital signs remained stable, local drainage was well controlled, and the extent of necrosis was localized, we decided to continue conservative treatment. Collagen peptides were subsequently added to his enteral nutrition to promote wound healing. Endoscopy on POD 46 showed necrotic tissue shedding and mucosal neoformation (Fig. e and f). Moreover, the anterior drainage tube at the anastomosis was observed on endoscopy. Accordingly, the anterior wall side of the anastomosis was considered to have dropped out due to necrosis. Furthermore, the periphery of the anastomosis showed mucosal neogenesis after necrotic tissue prolapse, while the route of the abdominal drain tube was fistulized. The drain tube was shallowly extracted and adjusted to allow the opening to heal and close. On POD 52, drainage contrast study showed closure of the anastomotic leakage, after which the patient was allowed to start drinking water. While endoscopy on POD 60 showed healing of gastric necrosis and closure of the anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis had been observed to the extent that only the endoscopic fiber could pass through. Thereafter, the W-ED tube was removed, enteral feeding was terminated, and the patient started on a liquid diet. Endoscopic anastomotic dilatation was performed on POD 66 (Fig. a and b), and after several anastomotic dilatations, the patient was able to consume solid food. The patient subsequently developed a urinary tract infection, which was controlled using antibacterial medication, and was discharged home on POD 88.\nRegarding nutritional status, the patient had a preoperative serum albumin level of 4.1 g/dL. During the course of the treatment, his lowest serum albumin level was 1.7 g/dL, which gradually recovered with enteral nutritional management and increased to 2.9 g/dL prior to discharge. The patient had a preoperative weight and body mass index of 73 kg and 25.6, respectively, and a body composition showing 46.2 kg of muscle mass, 24.2 kg of body fat, and 33.2% body fat percentage.

She had no remarkable family medical history, but her husband had Lewy body dementia and was in need of long-term care. Regarding the history of here present illness, she came to our clinic in December X−1 for abnormal behavior based on amnesia and paranoia, such as buying too many vegetables that she could not use, rotting them in the refrigerator, being unable to clean her room, and repeatedly washing her clothes while saying “my husband is dirty.” She had high neuropsychological test scores of 28 on the MMSE and 16 on the FAB; and her ADLs were not abnormally rated low, as indicated by scores of 33 on the DASC-21, 7 on the Lawton IADL scale, and 2 on the level of support required. Neurological examination showed no tendon reflex, left-right hyperactivity, or pathological reflex; and no atrophy was observed in the medial temporal lobe on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with coronal transection imaging. However, cerebral blood flow SPECT showed significant blood flow reduction in the anterior part of the bilateral precuneus, which led to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\nShe was attending local clinics for internal medicine and orthopedic surgery, but her conditions were poorly controlled, with polypharmacy and a diastolic blood pressure of over 100 mmHg. In our hospital, the patient was not treated with anti-dementia medication and adjustments to her medication regimen were initiated. She was also diagnosed with colorectal cancer and underwent a colectomy in January X. After discharge from the hospital, she weighed 50.6 kg, but her weight increased to 54.4 kg in July X with repeated dietary and nutritional guidance aimed at improving the breakfast menu with a focus on increasing energy levels. However, in September X, depressive symptoms such as “feeling lightheaded and agitated” became noticeable, with frequent missed meals and a decrease in the amount of food intake, which decreased her weight by 1.1 to 53.3 kg in 2 months. Muscle mass measured by a body composition analyzer (InBody 270) using bioelectrical impedance analysis was 32.6 kg. The weight after removing the body fluid weight (24.5 kg) from the total body weight (53.3 kg) was 28.8 kg. Since September X, she started taking 3.75 g "

The animal weighed 104 kg at capture, and the examination revealed broad muscle necrosis and rupture of the snared ankle on the right thoracic limb with myiasis (Fig. a); blood tests showed increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine phosphokinase. Thus, surgical amputation of the injured limb was required and we operated on September 09, 2017. The animal was immobilized with the standard method prescribed for ABB by Jeong et al. []. Briefly, intramuscular injections of zolazepam-tiletamine (2 mg/kg; Zoletil 50®) and medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg; Domitor®) was administered from a distance of 5 m using a CO2-powered gun (Dan-inject); anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (Terrell®, Piramal Critical Care, Bethlehem, PA, USA) in 100% oxygen (4 L/min) administered via a 10-mm endotracheal tube intubation in a circle rebreathing system. After intubation, the bear received injections of glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg, IM; Mobinul®, Myungmoon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea), cefovecin sodium (8 mg/kg, SC; Convenia®, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA), tramadol (2 mg/kg, IM; Humedix Tramadol HCl INJ.®, Huons Co., Ltd., Seongnam, South Korea), and meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, SC; Metacam®, Boehringer Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO, USA). Lactated Ringer’s solution (Hartmann’s Sol., Daihan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea) was administered intravenously at a rate of 10 ml/kg per hr. In addition, vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), rectal temperature, non-invasive blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO2) were monitored with a dedicated monitor (Datex-Ohmeda S/5, GE Healthcare Life Science, Helsinki, Finland).\nThe elbow disarticulation was performed and the procedure followed the method described by Winkler [] and Morrey [], with some modifications (Fig. b-d). Briefly, equal anterior and posterior skin flaps were created, beginning at the level of the humeral epicondyles. The incisions are extended distally, 5 cm distal to the tip of the olecranon posteriorly, and down to a point just distal to the insertion of the biceps tendon anteriorly. The lacertus fibrosus was divided and all the pronator attachments from the medial epicondyle were released. Then, the radial and ulnar nerves were transected and allowed to retract into the proximal wound. The large vessels were doubly ligated with 3–0 polyethylene terephthalate (Ti-CRON Polyester sutures, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and transected by an electro-thermal vessel sealing device (EVSD; LigaSure Max, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland); the small vessels were transected using the device alone, without ligation. The anterior, radiohumeral, and ulnohumeral capsules were divided, and trochlea and capitulum of the humerus were exposed. Then, the radius was disarticulated; however, it was difficult to disarticulate the ulna. Therefore, we performed an ostectomy of the ulna at the level of the trochlea, retaining the olecranon of the ulna, using an electric saw (BH 100S, IMEDICOM, Gunpo, South Korea). The posterior flap was moved medially and sutured continuously to the soft tissues of the medial epicondyle with 2–0 polyglyconate (Maxon®, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). The humerus was closed with a flap of the brachialis, biceps, and triceps, and the skin was closed with a simple interrupted suture of 1–0 nylon (Blue nylon NB125, Ailee, Busan, Korea) and skin stapler (Appose ULC 35 W, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After transportation to the rehabilitation room, 0.2 mg/kg atipamezole (Antisedan®, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) was injected intravenously, and the animal recovered from general anesthesia after a duration of 337 min uneventfully in a metal holding cage (2.2 × 0.8 × 1.2 m). The total surgery time was 268 min, and all parameters of intraoperative anesthetic evaluation were within the normal ranges (mean respiratory rate, 13.9 ± 1.7 breaths/min; mean heart rate, 54.4 ± 8.1 beats/min; mean rectal temperature, 35.9 ± 0.7 °C; mean blood pressure, 91.1 ± 11.8 mmHg; mean SpO2, 97.9 ± 4.5%; mean ETCO2, 30.5 ± 1.3%). The bear-01 stayed in the holding cage for 22 days and was visited twice daily for approximately 5 min for feeding (the first 5 days after the surgery) veterinary prescription diet (Recovery, Royal Canin, Aimargues, France) and fruits with honey; from days 6–22, acorns, chestnuts, fruits, vegetables, sweet potatoes, and commercial feed (Omnivore Diet Dry, ZuPreem, Mission, TX, USA), and medication (0.1 mg/kg meloxicam with food once a day for 14 days orally) were administered. No post-operative complications were observed during the stay.\nOn October 01, 2017, the bear-01 was moved to an indoor room (3 × 4 × 3 m; tiled floors and walls; direct sunlight via a 1 m × 1.4 m window on the roof) for light exercise and recovery and sta"

This two-month course was followed by a continuous phase of treatment. This comprised a daily two-drug combination including ethambutol 825 mg and isoniazid 450 mg. The two-drug combination was, however, substituted with only rifampicin about 11 weeks into the continuous phase when our patient reported blurred vision at the chest clinic where she was being managed. There was total withdrawal of the antituberculosis drug about two weeks later on account of persistent impaired visual function. By then, our patient had been receiving antituberculosis therapy for a period of five months, including the two-month intensive and three-month continuous phases.\nShe presented to our eye clinic about nine days after her antituberculosis drugs had been discontinued on account of her progressive painless diminishing vision of approximately one month's duration.

His body weight was 28 kg and height 147 cm, which is below the 2nd percentile for his age according to the growth chart. His BMI was 13.0, reflecting a 37% deficit in weight for his height [].\nUpon examination, he showed generalized muscle wasting, and his skin was dry and covered by lanugo hair. His chest was clear, and he had a scaphoid soft abdomen. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, heart rate 55 bpm and body temperature 37.8°C. Laboratory tests were as follows: blood glucose: 60 mg/dl, blood urea: 18 mg/d, serum sodium: 136 mg/dl, serum creatinine: 0.6 mg/dl, serum cholesterol: 147 mg/dl, WBC: 2200, platelet count: 150000, ESR: 1, and HB: 12 mg/dl. Blood proteins were low with slightly elevated liver enzymes. The blood culture was negative. Thyroid functions tests and steroid hormones were normal. General urine examination and culture revealed an acute bacterial infection, which accounted for his fever. Skull, spine and chest x-ray, brain scan and abdominal ultrasound were all normal. A previous gastroscopy at another hospital showed mild mucosal atrophy. An ECG revealed sinus bradycardia. The patient was smaller and shorter than his matching peers. He looked attentive but indifferent to his serious condition. His speech was rational and did not reveal delusions or hallucinations. However, he expressed strong denial of his body appearance and insisted he had a normal body shape. His mood was depressed, but he denied suicidal ideation.\nThe patient was admitted on 18th July 2010 to Sulimania General Hospital and was referred later for psychiatric consultation. A liaison treatment plan was designed by the attending physician, psychiatrist and dietitian focusing on scheduled feeding under the dietitian's advice, which was to be achieved through a nasogastric tube. Caloric intake was measured to reach 2000 calories per day, and he was instructed to rest in bed under a nurse's supervision. This ameliorated his previous hypoglycemic attacks. He was prescribed oral cephalosporin 250 mg qds to treat his urinary infection. On the second day of his admission, the psychiatrist prescribed a 20 mg daily dose of fluoxetine to treat his depressed mood and food-related obsessions. A 5 mg nightly dose of olanzapine was prescribed to resolve the distorted thoughts about his body image and promote sedation. Nasogastric refeeding was continued for the first week in the hospital until oral feeding was established. The tube was removed on the 6th day. In addition, a few sessions of cognitive psychotherapy were conducted with the patient.\nAt the end of the third week, he became more realistic and rational about his body weight and was more compliant with eating normal meals. His mood and irritability improved. He was discharged after 24 days in the hospital, advised to abide by the regulations of the dietitian and continue his medication for three months. He was to report to the psychiatry clinic on alternate weeks. His body weight had increased to 30 kg.\nHe did not keep his appointments and appeared six months "

Besides the asymmetrical skull dysplasia, the girl also presented with an acromegalic appearance. Laboratory evaluations revealed a massive hyperprolactinemia of 5475 mU/L (normal range < 500 mU/L), high growth hormone levels (that is, 43.2 mU/mL at 8 a.m.), and an elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) of 892 ng/mL (age-related normal range, 111 ng/mL to 693 ng/mL). Her alkaline phosphatase was 690 U/L (normal range, 51 U/L to 332 U/L). A pituitary adenoma was seen on magnetic resonance imaging, located within the massively expanded dysplastic skull base (Figure ). An ophthalmological examination revealed neither diplopia nor any other subjective impairment of her vision. There was a mild paleness of her optic nerve papilla and mild left-sided hemianopia.\nThe case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference for the four problems, that is, her facial disfigurement, possible danger to her left visual nerve and the pituitary tumor leading to local pressure and acromegaly. Besides the futility and probable enormous difficulty of cosmetic surgery, our patient and her mother refused any further surgical interventions for this purpose. A surgical intervention at her pituitary gland appeared difficult due to its complete impaction within the dysmorphic, fibrous bone of her skull base. Therefore, we did not obtain a histopathology specimen, and so it was not possible to tell whether the pituitary tumor was a lesion of acidophils, prolactin cells or both. Radiotherapy of her pituitary gland by conventional or gamma-knife irradiation was considered as too toxic, especially since malignant transformation is a well-known possible late effect, particularly in fibrous dysplasia tissues [].\nThus, based on published experiences in McCune-Albright syndrome [,,,], at the age of twelve years, our patient started pharmacological treatment. First, to treat the fibrous dysplasia, we initiated parenteral bisphosphonate therapy with pamidronic acid (Aredia), given every four weeks with a dosage of 30 mg, which equals about 0.4 mg per kilogram body weight. This was done by continuous infusion over four hours with cardiorespiratory monitoring and included regular examination of her kidney and liver function parameters.\nIn parallel, cabergoline, as the current standard therapy of prolactinomas, was given with a stepwise escalation of the dosage to reach a level of 2 mg twice weekly, which was tolerated well. Regular controls of blood pressure and cardiac function were included.\nThe clinical course was monitored regularly in monthly to three monthly intervals. The therapy was tolerated well. No acute side effects, such as rash, nausea, electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal impairment, occurred. Further, the continuous treatment, which has been extended without change for two and a half years, was not associated with osseous necrosis of the jaw or elsewhere, nephrocalcinosis or cardiac valve fibrosis.\nMagnetic resonance imaging showed no further progression of the fibrous dysplasia; her osseous status has remained unchanged for two and a half years. Her alkaline phosphatase, initially elevated up to 690 U/L, declined to 587 U/L after one year, and 417 U/L after two years of therapy.\nHer visually evoked potentials showed a mild prolongation after the first six months of therapy, which did not go along with any subjective symptoms.\nEndocrinological tests showed an immediate and rapid response of prolactin, which fell to the normal range within two months of therapy and have remained completely suppressed since. In parallel, we observed a normalization of her growth hormone levels, and her IGF-1 level fell to normal levels after four months. The growth of our patient slowed down, her final length of 180 cm was, however, much higher than her mid parental expectation"

Cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal and neurological examinations showed no abnormalities, but the skin was observed to be dry with decreased turgor. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated to 3,665 IU/l and 1,495 IU/l, respectively. Serological tests for HBsAg and anti-HCVAb were negative. The prothrombin time was 52%. Elevated levels of serum bilirubin, creatinine and urea nitrogen were also observed. Thyroid hormone levels were normal (). Abdominal CT showed a normal liver and the liver/spleen attenuation ratio was 1.08 (hepatic CT attenuation was 65.6 Hu). Due to severe emaciation, subcutaneous or visceral fat was hardly observed (). Abdominal US showed a homogeneous liver pattern and the liver/kidney contrast was not enhanced ().\nTPN was initiated at 1,000 kcal/day (20 kcal/kg standard body weight/day or 40 kcal/kg actual body weight/day). Phosphorus was also added to the TPN to avoid refeeding syndrome. In addition, 100 ml Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC; Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered every day to improve the AST and ALT levels, but was discontinued due to secondary aldosteronism on the eighth day, resulting in increases in AST and ALT levels (). SNMC treatment was resumed on the 13th day, and the serum AST and ALT levels were reduced to 74 and 150 IU/l, respectively. However, total bilirubin levels increased to 15.9 mg/dl on the 20th day.

50590,1.473,58.0in,34.0,75.0 pounds,15.67,0.0,"d=11678, d_ctx=1080","al onset of pain was attributed to a six-mile hike carrying 75 pounds of weight on his back as part of an elite training program. The pain was initially produced with walking, jogging, impact activities, and with manual resistance applied to the foot during plantar flexion and inversion of the ankle. The pain persisted for five weeks despite conservative treatment to include an initial course of physical therapy, at which point the patient was issued an orthopedic walker boot by the primary care physician (PCP). The goal was to allow the patient to remain functional while reducing potential re-injury or prolonging the inflammatory process. This treatment approach was similar to that in a clinical study described by Michelson and Dunn []. In this approach, immobilization is utilized when stretching of the FHL is too painful or when pain persists despite an adequate course of stretching.\nAfter two weeks, the pain persisted with weight-bearing and he was prescribed crutches by his PCP. The patient was referred for a second course of physical therapy two months post-injury. Under physical therapy guidance, the patient underwent a six-week rehabilitation program. The initial plan included reducing the use of crutches and boot along with instruction in a home exercise program consisting of gastrocnemius and soleus stretching and ankle strengthening. Clinic-based treatment was performed twice a week for three weeks to address strength, flexibility, and proprioception deficits. During this period, an MRI was ordered. The only pertinent finding was tenosynovitis of the FHL and FDL in the axial plane (Figure ) and in the coronal plane (Figure ). At reassessment six weeks later, a progressive walk to jog at his own pace plan was added to his home program.\nAfter six months of persistent pain, the patient was referred to a podiatrist. Treatment options offered included 4 mg of methylprednisolone three times a day for six days, which did not provide significant relief. Reassessments were performed by the podiatrist two and four months after the initial evaluation. At the first follow-up visit, the patient’s pain area had expanded to include the heel. Plantar fasciitis was added to the diagnosis and custom orthotic shoe insoles were fabricated. The patient did not have morning pain along the heel, a classic symptom of plantar fasciitis [].\nAt the next visit two months later, posterior tibialis tendon tenderness was appreciated in addition to chronic medial arch pain, and the differential evolved to include posterior tibialis tendonitis. The patient was referred for the third time to physical therapy for the additional posterior tibialis tendonitis diagnosis; however, given the chronicity of symptoms and lack of response to previous courses of physical therapy, the patient was redirected to physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist. A repeat MRI demonstrated the same FHL and FDL tenosynovitis as compared to the previous one; however, there were no MRI findings consistent with plantar fasciitis. The PM&R specialist considered performing an ultrasound-guided steroid injection into the affected FHL tendon sheath, but knowing that this would not alleviate the underlying biomechanical dysfunction, the patient was subsequently referred to physical therapy within the Interdisciplinary Pain Management Clinic (IPMC) for evaluation and management. Upon initial presentation, the patient’s goals were diagnostic clarity and to pass work-based physical fitness tests.\nPhysical examination\nPhysical evaluation at the IPMC revealed that the patient’s pain was localized to the plantar surface of the left medial arch, the abductor hallucis muscle below the navicular bone, and along the flexor digitorum, posterior tibialis, and flexor hallucis tendons superior to the tarsal tunnel. The pain was reported as a 5/10 on a visual analog scale where 0 indicated no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable.\nThe patient reported pain increased to a 10/10 with running. In standing, the patient was apprehensive to fully bear weight on the involved side; consequently, he would shift his weight to the unaffected foot. An antalgic gait was appreciated with intense pain at the terminal stance. Ankle range of motion was within normal limits except active dorsiflexion, which was limited to 5 degrees due to tightness of the gastrocnemius/soleus complex. Passive dorsiflexion was within normal limits. Manual muscle testing revealed pain provocation with the contraction of the FDL and FHL muscles. Joint mobility testing was performed. Translation of the first, second, and third metatarsals was painful. Loading of the first metatarsal reproduced pain in patients with FHL tenosynovitis by mimicking stress placed upon the first ray as the heel rises prior to the foot leaving the ground []. The distraction of the talocrural joint revealed hypomobility and pain provocation at the medial arch.\nDiagnosis/prognosis\nDifferential diagnosis specific to this patient’s symptoms upon initial evaluation to the IPMC were extensive and included posterior impingement syndrome, plantar fasciitis, os trigonum, intersection syndrome at the master knot of Henry, tibialis posterior tendinopathy, FDL and FHL tendinopathy, and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Due to the lack of morning pain, the lack of paresthesias, and no accessory bone on imaging, plantar fasciitis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, and os trigonum, respectively, were low on the differential. An MRI did show tenosynovitis of the FHL and FDL in this patient. Given the chronicity of symptoms and his signs and symptoms, the working diagnosis was consistent with a tendinopathy /dysfunction of the FHL, FDL, or both.\nThe prognosis for full resolution of symptoms was moderate to poor given the chronicity of symptoms, the poor response to adequate trials of physical therapy, lack of response to anti-inflammatories and immobilization, and the patient’s expectations to be pain-free. However, the patient was very motivated and wished to proceed with treatment.\nIntervention\nThe plan of care included manual therapy, stretching, strengthening, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), and activity modification (Table ). The rehabilitation program was designed to incorporate serial assessments, clinic-based osteopathic manipulation technique (OMT) and IASTM, and a self-management program between visits that were to occur every one to two weeks based on his response to each treatment.\nThe patient was treated during the initial evaluation with OMT directed at the talocrural joint described by Whitman et al. (Figure ) and deep tissue mobilization []. OMT has been shown to be effective in redistributing load in the foot in patients following ankle inversion injuries and may correct faulty subtalar motion in patients with FHL stenosing tenosynovitis [,]. Another potential benefit of this treatment method includes an analgesic effect []. Manual deep tissue mobilization was applied to the FDL and FHL muscles and tendons superior to the inferior extensor retinaculum for five minutes. This is the same area that these tendons are accessed during a posteromedial approach for tenolysis []. Both techniques provoked an immediate increase in pain. However, after treatment, the patient reported significantly less pain during ambulation. The patient was instructed to perform the tissue mobilization technique daily utilizing a racquetball. The patient would lie on his right side placing the medial aspect of his lower third of the left lower leg on top of the racquetball. He then would slide his leg up so that the racquetball rolled towards the medial ankle and back for a period of two to five minutes. Other home exercises prescribed included intrinsic muscles strengthening by scrunching a towel with his toes to offset the force of the extrinsic muscles and gastrocnemius and soleus stretching for a period of two weeks.\nUpon follow-up (two weeks after the initial evaluation), the patient reported a short-term reduction in pain, but pain did return to his baseline pain level of 5/10 due to participating in a work-related exercise event. Tenderness to palpation was appreciated along the medial arch and plantar surfaces, as well as the FDL and FHL at the tarsal tunnel. The initial treatment of OMT to the talocrural joint was repeated. IASTM with an Arthrostim® (Salem, Oregon) was applied to the FHL, FDL, and heel cord. The patient was instructed to focus his self-tissue mobilization along the FDL and FHL tendons between the muscle belly and the inferior extensor retinaculum for another two-week period.\nBy the third visit (four weeks after the initial evaluation), the patient’s pain level ranged from a 1/10 to a 5/10. No pain was appreciated with palpation of or contraction of the FHL. The FDL continued to be painful during testing. The previous treatment was repeated with a reduction in pain. The patient was reassessed two weeks later, with reported pain continuing to range from 1/10 with standing to 5/10 with prolonged walking. Notably, less pain was reproduced with the contraction of the FDL. There was pain along the plantar fascia with passive dorsiflexion of the toes, which is indicative of plantar fasciitis []. While there was no arch pain in the morning, it was prudent to treat these symptoms as presumptive plantar fasciitis. To unload the plantar fascia while weight-bearing, a custom fabricated plantar fascia orthosis (PFO) was applied []. Figure shows the PFO applied in the frontal plane while Figure shows the PFO applied in the sagittal plane. The patient wore this orthotic consistently in his shoes and boots. After one week, the patient’s pain level was 0/10. The physical exam was benign and jogging on a treadmill did not produce pain with push-off. The PFO was discontinued and the patient started a walk to jog progression.\nAt the sixth visit (two months after the initial evaluation), the patient reported no pain after running one mile on three occasions over the previous week. The patient was instructed to slowly increase his jogging distance with the goal of jogging two miles, a requirement to pass a physical fitness test. The patient was instructed to follow up if he experienced any recurrence in pain.\nTwo months later (four months after the initial evaluation), the patient re-injured his foot after running down a steep decline involving 1000 steps. The examination revealed pain along the navicular bone with pressure applied from a superior to inferior direction and pain along the plantar fascia. Navicular mobility was addressed with OMT, which immediate reduction in pain while weight bearing from a 4/10 to a 2/10. The PFO was reapplied for one week, thereby reducing the plantar pain to a 1/10. The patient followed up two weeks later for a video-based running assessment. The patient was instructed to improve his arm swing in the sagittal plane and try a mid-foot running technique.\nThe patient enjoyed another two-month period of pain relief, but he returned with a new complaint of pain along the posterior tibialis tendon. It was presumed that switching to the mid-foot running technique may have resulted in these symptoms. IASTM to the posterior tibialis muscle from the origin to the tendon above the inferior extensor retinaculum resulted in no pain after treatment. One month later, the patient was reassessed (11th visit). The patient reported pain and transient tingling along the tarsal tunnel after jogging greater than two miles. Significant swelling of the FHL sheath can compress the adjacent posterior tibial nerve []. A Tinel’s sign was present with reproduction of the paresthesia. The Tinel’s sign has a sensitivity of 0.58 in assessing tarsal tunnel syndrome [].\nIASTM was applied usi"

He is a retired maintenance worker and never smoker with no alcohol use. The kidney of his biological brother was transplanted into the right iliac fossa with end to side anastomosis of graft renal vessels to the external iliac vessels. The surgical course was uneventful. Surgery was performed by a board certified transplant surgeon with over 10 years of experience at a regional community practice. Pre-operative creatinine was 3.3 mg/dl. Post-operative creatinine was 3.1 mg/dl and increased to 3.3 mg/dl on post-operative day one. Urine output was satisfactory at 220 ml/h. Immediate post-operative ultrasound showed no evidence of perinephric fluid collection and low-normal renal artery peak systolic velocity measures of 41 cm/s at the hilum, 46 cm/s at the mid-portion, and 57 cm/s at the anastomosis with resistive indices of 0.6 at the upper, middle, and lower pole. On post-operative day one, repeat ultrasound revealed decreasing renal artery peak systolic velocities at the hilum (32 cm/s) and mid-portion (33 cm/s), but increased peak systolic velocity at the anastomosis (129 cm/s) with resistive indices of 0.73 at the upper, 0.63 at the middle, and. 0.60 at the lower pole. Follow-up renal nuclear medicine scan showed delayed perfusion to the renal transplant. Renal CO2 angiogram demonstrated evidence of kinking of the transplant's renal artery (). Renal angiogram with judicious contrast supported this finding as well (). Attempted balloon angioplasty revealed a lesion that did not behave like a true stenosis in that very little resistance was encountered during inflation with no stricture noted in the balloon (). Renal angiogram showed continued kinking after deflation of the balloon (). This evaluation and attempted angioplasty was performed by a board certified interventional radiologist with more than 15 years of experience at a regional community practice. Due to unsuccessful angioplasty and evidence of mechanical kinking on renal angiogram, the patient underwent surgical evaluation, and a renal artery kink was identified 1.5 cm distal to the anastomosis. The graft was repositioned with upper pole placed in the posterior pelvis and lower pole positioned towards the incision to avoid kinking of the vasculature. The operative course was uneventful. Post-operative ultrasound revealed increasing peak renal artery systolic velocities at the hilum (268 cm/s, high-resistance wave form), mid-portion (128 cm/s), and anastomosis (173 cm/s, high-resistance wave form) with resistive indices of 0.5"

She was adherent to a daily, therapeutic dose of enoxaparin, and on admission, she transitioned to a heparin infusion, which was stopped 10 hours before the surgery. She reported longstanding dyspnea while supine, both before and throughout pregnancy. She could breathe comfortably in a 30° semi-upright position. Preoperatively, she underwent ultrasound-guided placement of a radial arterial line and two 18-gauge (G) peripheral IV lines.\nIn the obstetric operating room (OR), she was placed in a seated position on the operating table for placement of the neuraxial catheter. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry (SpO2), and blood pressure monitoring were initiated. A 4-inch-wide medical tape used horizontally held her skin folds pulled laterally, and her spinous processes were palpated. An intrathecal catheter was planned to allow incremental dosing up to T4-T6 sensory level and minimize the risk of high neuroblockade or respiratory distress. The catheter also provided an option for redosing, in case of prolonged surgery. The patient strongly preferred neuraxial anesthesia, though the possibility of general endotracheal anesthesia was also discussed with her in the event that neuraxial block proved impossible or impractical. Her airway exam was reassuring, revealing Mallampati class I, full cervical range of motion, and normal oral opening and thyromental distance. Positioning for and placement of the neuraxial catheter took 45 minutes from OR entry to the completion of the procedure.\nA 6-inch (15.2 cm), 17-G Tuohy epidural needle was used, and saline loss-of-resistance followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow occurred at 13-cm depth at the L3/4 interspace. The 20-G catheter was advanced 6 cm into the intrathecal space. The catheter was then taped with the patient still in the sitting position. Eight people then repositioned the patient into a 45° semi-upright position. Oxygen supplementation of 3 L/minute via nasal cannula was begun, and the intrathecal catheter was dosed. Hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg, fentanyl 15 mcg, and morphine 100 mcg were given and saline was flushed in 0.25-mL increments over 12 minutes to gradually produce a T4 sensory blockade. During this interval, the patient was gradually lowered down to a 30° semi-upright position. Arterial pressure monitoring showed a lack of significant aortocaval compression despite no left uterine displacement. Motor block and sensory block height were assessed prior to each incremental dose. This 30° semi-upright position was then maintained throughout the procedure to minimize respiratory difficulty. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was immediately available intraoperatively. She breathed comfortably throughout the delivery, including with pannus tape retraction, maintaining SpO2 >95%. A supraumbilical, vertical skin incision followed by classical (vertical) hysterotomy was performed, as the obstetricians had determined that this approach would enable the best access to the uterus for safe delivery of her fetus. No additional local anesthetic was required, and the intrathecal catheter was removed without incident at the end of the procedure. Incision to closure time was 68 minutes, and the total time spent in the OR was 176 minutes. Postpartum, she recovered in the surgical intensive care unit and required CPAP while asleep. After 24 hours, she was moved to an inpatient ward with continuous ECG and SpO2 monitoring. Her postpartum course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged home on postpartum day four. She did not develop any postdural puncture headache (PDPH).\nSecond delivery\nEighteen months after her first delivery, our patient returned at 36 weeks and four days of gestation on the day of surgery for elective repeat cesarean (preterm due to her prior classical uterine incision) and bilateral tubal ligation.

Blood pressure was 120/93 mmHg. Other physical examination was unremarkable, tonsils were normal in appearance, the abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds, and he had no dependent edema. His initial laboratory workup was the following: creatinine, 96 μmol/L (40–135); estimated glomerular filtration rate, 101 ml/min/1.73 m2 (CKD-EPI formulae); albumin, 38.6 g/L (40–55); blood leucocytes, 5.56 × 109/L (3.5–9.5); hemoglobin, 148 g/L (130–175); Other blood examinations were normal, including tests for antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and complement C3 and C4. Urine microscopy showed 1765 RBC/high-power field with no casts, and 24-hour urine protein was 4.71 g.\nConsidering the persistent gross hematuria for more than 1 week with relatively normal renal function, Doppler ultrasonography was done, which revealed that LRV that runs between the aorta and the SMA is very narrow, and the anteroposterior diameter at the hilar portion divided by that at the aortomesenteric portion was 8.8 (1.06 cm/0.12 cm), and the ratio of LRV peak velocity (aortomesenteric portion to the hilar = 159 cm/sec/15 cm/sec) was 10.6 and the aortomesenteric angle was 1"

A presumptive diagnosis of arrested puberty associated with an eating disorder was assumed, and the patient was referred to the Pediatrics Department, where he was admitted to the ward and enrolled in a multidisciplinary team approach, including Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Psychology, Endocrinology, and Nutrition. General biochemical evaluation is resumed in . An abdominal ultrasound excluded steatosis and other hepatobiliary diseases, the electrocardiogram was unremarkable, and chest radiography grossly excluded organic pathologies as causes of weight loss. Psychiatric evaluation suggested an atypical case of AN. A personality with perfectionist traits was revealed, encouraged by a central role played in his family. He also showed fusional relationship with his mother and lack of autonomy for his age. Unlike his twin, he received many family expectations regarding school performance and admission to a reputable university. Neither body image distortion nor anxiety disorder was perceived. The calorie counting was attributed to a need for control due to his perfectionist personality and obsessive personality traits. He was discharged with a weight of 34 kg, 14 days after initiation of a dietary plan and multidiscip"

Physical examination on admission showed: a height of 150 centimeters; a weight of 72 kilograms; a waistline of 120cm; a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg; capillary blood sugar at 2.19 g/l, with a typical clinical picture of hypercorticism with the presence of a painful hip during motion without limitation of movement. The hormonal balance found a urinary free cortisol (UFC) level raised to 4 times the normal, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was at the lower limit of the normal value at 14 µg/ml (10-60).\nThe adrenal CT scan revealed a well-defined right adrenal mass measuring 46 x 33mm, spontaneously hypodense taking the contrast product heterogeneously, the left adrenal was normal non-hypertrophic (). As complications of her hypercorticism, the patient had diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, high blood pressure, diffuse bone demineralization complicated by aseptic necrosis of the right femoral head diagnosed on standard radiography of the hip () and pelvic scan and for which she was put on discharge and bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis. Once the diagnosis of ACTH independent Cushing's syndrome was reached, a right adrenalectomy was performed by laparoscopy, the postoperative consequences were simple with, as a sign of remission, the occurrence of acute adrenal insufficiency on the third postoperative day, which has been substituted.\nHistological examination with complementary immunohistochemical study showed a right adrenal gland measuring 50 x 40 x 25mm, the nodules measure between 0.5 and 1.5cm, with a nodular chamois yellow appearance. Microscopic examination revealed a hyperplasia of the adrenal parenchyma with an increase in the number of spongiocytes, the complementary immunohistochemical study showed an expression of cytokeratin and chromogranin A in favor of hyperplasia. In conclusion, it was macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. Remission was clinically defined by the disappearance of clinical signs of hypercorticism; the patient´s weight decreased from 72 to 56 kilograms; her hyperglycemia showed clear improvement, fasting blood "

A hormonal panel found a UFC level elevated to twice the normal at 520 μg/24h, plasma ACTH was at 18 μg/ml (10-60). Adrenal CT scan showed a right adrenal gland containing a nodule which is enhanced shortly after injection of contrast agent and measures approximately 28 mm, the left adrenal was of normal non-hypertrophic morphology. High blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy shown on echocardiography and depression were all complications of hypercorticism that were found in the patient.\nOnce the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome was made, a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed. Histological examination showed a right adrenal gland measuring 45 x 30mm. The multiple samples examined show an adrenal parenchyma surrounded by a thin and sometimes moderately thick fibrous shell with emanations towards the parenchyma. On microscopic examination, it was a hyperplasia of the adrenal parenchyma involving the cells of the medulla and the cortex with a predominance of spongiocyte, as well as the presence of small foci of compact cells with nuclear atypia. In conclusion, it was macro nodular adrenal hyperplasia. Five years after the surgery, clinical evolution was marked by the regression of the signs of Cushing syndrome and the persistence of a slight facial erythrosis, the weight went from 82 to 64 kilograms, although the patient kept residual high blood pressure, it"

The blood pressure in her extremities was symmetrical, and she had no abnormal vascular murmur.\nLaboratory results in August 2020 (Tables and ) indicated that the WBC count and neutrophils were in the normal ranges, and the hemoglobin was slightly low. Indicators of infection and inflammation, including procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were obviously increased. We also measured the levels of multiple cytokines. The level of interleukin (IL) -6 was significantly elevated, the level of IL-10 was slightly elevated, but the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, INF-γ, and TNF were normal. Tests for mycoplasma and herpes simplex virus-IgM antibodies were positive. Screening for tumor markers, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), indicated no abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration results were negative. Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) and whole abdominal enhanced CT results indicated no apparent abnormalities, while echocardiography and subclavian artery ultrasound were also normal. We administered anti-infective therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin after hospitalization. After 3 days, her body temperature returned to normal, and her CRP level decreased to 40.4 mg/L.\nAt 2 days after admission, her serum creatinine was slightly increased at 87.9 μmol/L (reference range: 33 ~ 75 μmol/L), and 99mTc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging indicated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 74.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (reduced renal function). Urinalysis indicated hematuria and proteinuria, and analysis of urinary sediment indicated 2 erythrocyte casts per HPF and 34.7 RBCs per HPF, with a dysmorphic rate of 60%. She tested positive for ANA (1:1000), but negative for anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-GBM, ANCA (PR3-ANCA, cANCA, MPO-ANCA, pANCA), and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies (PLA2R). The complement C3 and C4 levels were in the normal range, although the serum IgE was increased. Kidney ultrasound showed that both kidneys were enlarged with increased renal cortex echoes and blurred cortical and medullary boundaries.\nTherefore we performed a kidney biopsy and examined 25 glomeruli using microscopy (Fig. ). Seven glomeruli had global sclerosis, 1 had cellular crescents, 11 had fibro cellular crescents, and 4 had fibrous crescents. The remaining glomerular aberrations were mild, with open capillary loops and no significant alterations in the mesangial area. However, the visceral and parietal epithelial cells were swollen, and Bowman’s capsule thickened and stratified. The renal tubular epithelial cells had granular degeneration, multifocal tubular atrophy (45%), the absence of tubular structures with interstitial fibrosis, and infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes. There were no apparent changes in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated 6 glomeruli had granular deposition of IgG (+) in the mesangial area and capillary wall, but the other results were negative (IgA−, IgM−, C1q−, Fib−, and C3±). Electron microscopy indicated one glomerulus had a slightly increased segmental glomerular mesangial matrix, a small number of electron-dense regions scattered in the mesangial area, swollen podocytes and parietal epithelial cells, and a collapsed capillary basement membrane. The thickness of the GBM was normal, and there was no evidence of delamination, tearing, or arachnoid changes. There were also no thickened inner lighter layers of the GBM. The mitochondria of the renal tubular epithelial cells were swollen, and the endoplasmic reticulum was expanded. The basement membranes of some tubules were thickened, and collagen fibers and a small number of monocytes and lymphocytes were present in the interstitium. There were no apparent changes in the arterioles.\nOur results indicated the patient had ANCA-negative PICGN. We administered 2 courses of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500 mg/day for 3 days each), and then oral prednisone (60 mg/day) with gradual tapering. We simultaneously administered intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg/day for 2 days each month) and oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 0.75 in the morning, 0.5 in the evening).

She had a PEG insertion done 8 years ago and then received regular PEG tube change every 3 months by the nurses and maintained well on the gastrostomy bolus milk feeding. Her body weight was static over the past years and there was no sign or symptoms of malnutrition or diarrhea.\nShe presented to our gastroenterology unit for failure to deflate the PEG balloon during a regular PEG exchange due to blockage of the inflation/deflation catheter. Upon admission, the physical examination of the abdomen was normal with active bowel sound and negative for any distension or tenderness. The routine blood tests including complete blood picture, electrolytes, and liver and renal function tests did not review any abnormality. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) was arranged with an attempt to examine and deflate the balloon in the stomach endoscopically. An OGD examination failed to identify any gastrostomy tube in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) lumen with the scope passed down to the second part of the duodenum. An urgent computer tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed the distal end of the PEG tube was likely situated at the proximal jejunum distal to the duodenojejunal junction with a normal fill-filled balloon intraluminally. There was no radiological feature of pneumoperitoneum ().

Antenatal anomaly scanning at 25 weeks gestation detected a cystic abnormality of the left kidney. The patient had passed a small amount of meconium within the first 24 hours of life. She presented to our centre on day 4 of life with feed intolerance and bilious vomiting. Clinical examination revealed moderate abdominal distension but was otherwise unremarkable. An urgent upper gastrointestinal contrast study (UGI) was diagnostic for malrotation (Fig.1A). The patient subsequently underwent emergency laparotomy which confirmed malrotation without volvulus. The bowel was otherwise normal in appearance and a Ladd procedure was performed.\nThe post-operative course was complicated by failure to establish feeds, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence and ongoing large volume bilious aspirates from the nasogastric tube. Associated anomaly workup during this period revealed bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia, bilateral peri-sylvianpolymicrogyria, absent septum pellucidum and septo-optic dysplasia on MRI brain and polycystic left kidney with ectopic left ureter on renal ultrasonography. Parents were non-consanguineous and genetics workup was normal.\nOngoing obstructive symptoms (Fig.1B) beyond the 3rd postoperative week including feculent vomits and failure of spontaneous bowel opening prompted further evaluation for alternative pathology including a rectal suction biopsy which revealed an absence of ganglion cells on calretinin staining, indicating a diagnosis of HD. On Day 40 of life a second laparotomy was undertaken. Following adhesiolysis (from the previous Ladd procedure) a calibre change at the mid-small bowel was noted. Levelling frozen section biopsies confirmed total colonic aganglionosis extending into the small bowel to 50cms from the ileocecal valve. Resection of the aganglionic small bowel and subtotal colectomy to the level of the distal sigmoid was performed and an end ileostomy was formed at 140cm from the Duodeno-Jejunal (D-J) flexure.\nThe subsequent pos"

He experienced shortness of breath with minimal physical activity. Physical examination revealed severe cachexia with atrophy of all muscles without peripheral edema. He was also noted to be moderately dehydrated. Initial investigations were significant for mild hyponatremia [133 mmol/L (NL 135–145 mmol/L)], severe hypoalbuminemia [0.2 g/dL (NL 3.5–5.0 g/dL)], hypocalcemia [ionized calcium 3.2 mg/dL (NL 4.5–5.3 mg/dL)], severe iron deficiency anemia [hemoglobin/hematocrit 6.7 gm/dL/24.8%, MCV 69.3 FL], and selenium deficiency [32 ug/L]. The reported normal serum selenium levels in the United States ranges from 50 to 150 ug/L [] while the normal serum levels of selenium in his country of origin is reported to be 80.6–199 ug/L []. The carnitine level was normal.\nImmediate intravenous fluid resuscitation was initiated. Since he was severely malnourished and had limited ability for oral intake, high calorie enteral nutrition was administered via a nasogastric tube. An initial echocardiogram (echo) showed a globular dilated left ventricle with a severely depressed systolic function [ejection fraction (EF) < 25%] consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. He was initially treated with furosemide and enalapril, and carvedilol was added a week later since there was minimal improvement in cardiac function in addition to selenium replacement [200 mcg (2.5 umol) twice daily intravenously]. He received two blood transfusions and repeated albumin infusions within the first five days. One week later, his cardiac function dramatically improved [EF 46%]. His selenium level, as well as other labs, normalized within two weeks. The cardiac function normalized within four weeks. His weight continued to increase and reached 30 kg [BMI 15.1 kg/m2, z score −2.40] within four months (). All "

She came from a rural country of Guangdong province. Her mother did not have prenatal tests during the pregnancy, no miscarriages history and the family had no medical history of BWS. After birth, she showed macroglossia, earlobe crease, hypermyotonia and had feeding and airway issues. The macroglossia was evident at 2 months of age (Fig. ). Patient 2 was able to eat and speak normally and has reduced macroglossia at 32 months old (Fig. ).

Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) was performed for patient 1 using the Affymetrix Cytoscan 750 K array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions.

A cough (2 weeks’ duration) was reported, with an in-clinic respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min and increased expiratory effort. One week later, thoracic radiography and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; blind technique) were performed. Radiography showed evidence of a soft-tissue mass, cranial and dorsal to the cardiac silhouette, deviating the carina sternally (). A patchy alveolar pattern was present in the right middle and accessory lung lobes. There was no evidence of cardiomegaly or vascular distension. BAL yielded a profuse growth of Pasteurella species, with cytology supportive of neutrophilic inflammation.\nUpon referral, clinical findings were similar to those at initial assessment. Body weight had reduced to 4.29 kg (8% reduction over 14 days) with a BCS of 5/9. Rectal temperature was normal (38.6ºC). Complete blood count and serum biochemical profile showed no significant abnormalities; venous blood gas and electrolytes were within reference intervals. Serological tests for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV PCR were negative. A thoracic CT study (GE LightSpeed 16; GE Medical Systems) was elected and performed using helical acquisition, pre- and post-intravenous contrast medium administration. Images showed a large, contrast-enhancing mass at the heart base, which deviated the oesophagus dorsally and compressed the lumen of both principal bronchi, entirely obliterating the lumen of the left (). The left caudal lung was reduced in size with diffuse soft tissue attenuation. The cranial mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged. Ultrasound-guided needle aspirates of the mass yielded moderate numbers of cells with round nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, highly stippled chromatin and a single, prominent nucleolus. There was no evidence of an infectious process. The most likely differentials were considered to be a mesothelioma or neuroendocrine tumour (chemodectoma most probable, given the location). CT findings of pulmonary infiltrates were considered likely to represent lobar consolidation with possible secondary infection, caused by bronchial obstruction and a lack of normal mucociliary clearance.\nAfter consultation with the owners, palliative bronchial stenting was elected as the best option, owing to its minimally invasive nature and possibility of reducing the severity of dyspnoea. Radiation therapy was declined. Stent selection was based upon CT-acquired measurements of the bronchi: the length of the left principal bronchial compression was approximately 27.5 mm, the right 15.1 mm; diameter of the left bronchus prior to compression was 4.4 mm; comparable to the right side, which measured 4.6 mm. Two laser-cut self-expanding metallic stents were selected, measuring 5 mm diameter × 30 mm length, and were planned for deployment using a ‘kissing stents’ technique where the bronchial stents were deployed partially side by side in the trachea, to reduce the risk or rate of re-occlusion. Although commonly used in humans undergoing vascular interventions, this technique has also been performed for minimally invasive, palliative treatment for malignant bronchial obstruction in people.\nOne week later, after intravenous premedication with butorphanol 0.2 mg/kg, dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg and terbutaline 0.01 mg/kg (to reduce the risk of airway spasm and swelling during manipulations), the cat was induced using 0.5 mg/kg midazolam and 10 mg/kg ketamine (given slowly to effect) and intubated with a 4.5 mm endotracheal tube. Anaesthesia was maintained using a continuous rate infusion of alfaxalone (0.16 mg/kg/min) and manual intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) of 100% oxygen, using an Ayre’s T-piece. Perioperative antibiotics were administered (cefuroxime 20 mg/kg IV). Bronchoscopy (Olympus BF-P240 flexible video bronchoscope; Olympus Medical Systems) was performed in combination with fluoroscopic imaging (Arcadis Avantic C-arm; Siemens) to define the location of the carina (meeting point of the stents) and the location of the right middle and accessory lobar bronchi (RB2 and RB3) and the left caudal lobar bronchus (LB2). Complete occlusion of the left principal bronchus and compression of the right side were confirmed. Once these landmarks had been mapped on fluoroscopy, the cat was allowed a period of 5 mins pre-oxygenation (breathing 100% oxygen; Ayres’ T-piece, manual IPPV) before extubation for stenting, during which time SpO2 was consistently recorded at 92%, with arterial blood gas analysis measuring a PaO2 of only 100 mmHg, presumably associated with significant pulmonary compromise. Next, a 4 F Berenstein vascular catheter (4 F Berenstein 1 catheter 65 cm; Infiniti Medical) was advanced over a 0.035” angle-tipped hydrophilic ‘weasel’ guidewire (Infiniti Medical) into each of the principal bronchi. The weasel wires were removed and exchanged for more rigid 0.035” Rosen guidewires (0.035” 180 cm J-tip Rosen wire; Infiniti Medical), over which the Berenst"

He underwent tendon fractional release of the bilateral tendons of the semitendinosus muscle, semimembranosus muscle, and biceps femoris muscle. Achilles tendon lengthening was performed on the right equinus foot using Vulpius elongation. His lower limbs were fixed with above knee plaster splints in the knee extended position and intermediate ankle position 2 weeks after surgery, and he subsequently used short leg braces. Preoperative passive range of joint motion values were as follows: right knee 35–130/left knee 20–130, ankle dorsiflexion with knee extension (DKE) 15/15, and ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexion (DKF) 35/35. At 6 postoperative months, range of joint motion was right knee 15–130/left knee 10–130, DKE 15/10, and DKF 25/20. Knee extension range and DKF improved postoperatively. Preoperative manual muscle testing showed the following: knee extension 3/3, knee flexion 4/4, ankle dorsiflexion 1/1, and ankle plantar flexion 1/1. Before surgery, he had begun crawling in the house. Before HAL intervention, he could not move with crawling because of postoperative muscle weakness. It was thought that muscle weakness was due to disuse muscle atrophy after surgery.\nHybrid Assistive Limb intervention was administered twice during postoperative months 10 and 11 in an outpatient department.

Although the patient himself would be expected to advise others to first see a family physician for this kind of symptoms, he decided to use specialized care services at the university hospital he was working for in April 2015. Acquainted with the patient, the professor of gastroenterology ordered an immediate oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was reported as ‘hiatal insufficiency and antral gastritis’. The gastric biopsy specimen taken during the endoscopy session returned positive for Helicobacter pylori.\nThe patient was diagnosed as having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and prescribed a scheme of amoxicillin + clarithromycin + pantoprazole + bismuth subsalicylate. After a few days, he returned to his doctor complaining of medication side effects such as burning in his throat and oesophagus and not being able to swallow the pills. However, being warned of the consequences of non-compliance with the treatment, he kept using the medications as advised. There was no improvement in the initial symptoms at the end of the 14-days treatment. The patient was instructed to continue using pantoprazole 40 mg/day for another three months. However, he discontinued the medication after few weeks due to no apparent benefit.\nThe patient did not seek any other formal health advice for the next three years. He kept taking pantoprazole for a few days when his symptoms flared up. With time, he was used to his symptoms and learned to manage his condition by lifestyle changes such as eating less, chewing longer than usual, and arranging his sleep position. During an informal discussion with a family physician in June 2017, he was advised to see his family doctor, who took a thorough history, which revealed the following:The patient was reporting rare (once every three-to-four weeks) night coughs for more than 20 years. Initially, the cough was awakening from sleep but usually not reoccurring for a long time. His primary symptoms of the current episode of his disease started at the end of 2014, after a stressful event leading to a loss of his job. The principal symptom was dysphagia and a sense of fullness in his throat, which he described as ‘Having a bread loaf in his oesophagus’. He did not report any retrosternal burning or acid reflux. He usually woke every night with persistent cough attacks lasting 30–40 min. The cough increased in cold weather and sleeping in the supine position. Other exacerbating factors were drinking tea or coffee, consuming too hot or too cold food, as well as swallowing large mouthfuls of food. He was reporting undigested food coming back up into his mouth from the oesophagus, even one-to-two hours after a meal. There was a typical gurgling sound while swallowing, especially when drinking liquids. Recently (two-to-three months) he started to experience saliva oozing from his mouth onto the pillow while asleep. He needed to have a napkin ready to wipe his mouth when awoke. The patient reported a weight loss of 16 kg within the last year, dropping from 74 kg to 58 kg.\nHis family physician referred the patient to ano"

But she was not taking any treatment for this disorder. There was no significant medical history in the past. Physical examination revealed asthenic female, with a body temperature of 98.6°F. Neurological examination revealed nystagmus, ptosis, pupils unreactive to light, upward gaze palsy of the left eye, and gait ataxia. During intraoral examination, there were generalised smooth glossy erosions on the palatal surfaces of maxillary teeth and soft palate was found to be erythematous. During our evaluation, the patient denied mood disturbance and auditory/visual hallucinations or delusions; however, she did confabulate many stories. She was not oriented to time, person, and place. Short-term memory was not intact, as she was unable to remember three items after few minutes, even with cue recognition. Her insight of her illness was poor and she scored 16/30 on minimental state examination (MMSE). Complete blood count, serum glucose, blood urea, and serum creatinine and electrocardiogram (ECG) were within normal limits. Electrolytes were normal except potassium (2.2 meq/L), and magnesium levels were decreased (0.43 mg/dL). Folic acid was 2.1 ng/mL (NR = 3.2–17.0 ng/dL) and B12 was 250 pg/mL (NR = 202–900 mg/dL).

On the third day of his hospital stay, while still undergoing bladder irrigation, he suddenly experienced extreme shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and a cough with frothy sputum. The nurse attending him immediately noted that there was no return of the fluid (5 liters) introduced through bladder irrigation. No manual evacuation of the bladder was performed during the treatment.

The target height was 166.0 ± 6.0 cm (−1.70 SDS). All auxological data were normalized for chronological age by conversion to standard deviation scores (SDS) that were calculated according to the following formula: patient value - mean of age-related reference value/standard deviation of the age-related reference value [].\nThe child was born at 40 weeks of gestation with an uncomplicated delivery. The birth weight was 2970 g (−1.15 SDS), length at birth was 50 cm (−0.30 SDS), and his occipito-frontal head circumference (OFC) was 34 cm (−0.61 SDS). He had neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. The child’s neuromotor development was normal: he sat at 6 months, walked independently at 12 months, and began to use language at 14 months.\nAt 6 months, the patient exhibited very deficient growth (Fig. ). At 2 years and 3 months, he was admitted to our Paediatric Endocrine Unit for an endocrinological evaluation. His height, evaluated according the growth charts compiled by Cacciari et al. [], was 78.6 cm (−2.79 SDS). His weight was 9.830 kg (−2.78 SDS), and his BMI was 15.91 (−0.28 SDS) (Fig. ). Extensive biochemical, endocrinological and metabolic examinations did not reveal any abnormalities with the exception of plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 that were low for his age and sex: 27 ng/mL and 1.38 μg/mL, respectively. Thus, GH stimulation tests were performed and showed a reduced response after the clonidine (GH peak of 5.2 ng/mL) and insulin (glucose nadir 2.0 mmol/L at 30 min; GH peak of 3.9 ng/mL) tests. This revealed a GH deficiency (GHD). Bone age was assessed according to the Greulich and Pyle method [], and it was delayed (1 year and 2 months versus a chronological age of 2 years and 3 months). Brain MRI of the hypophyseal region showed the presence of a pituitary hypoplasia (height 1.8 mm and width 2.7 mm). Consequently, hGH therapy (0.22 mg/kg/wk) was started.\nThe child responded very well to rhGH treatment (Fig. ) and at 3 years and 4 months old, his height was 94.5 cm (−1.14 SDS), weight 12.450 kg (−2.10 SDS), height velocity 15.06 cm/yr (5.05 SDS), and BMI 13.94 (−1.75 SDS). At 4 years and 3 months old, his height was 101.9 cm (−0.82 SDS), his weight was 15.300 kg (−1.24 SDS), his height velocity was 8.05 cm/yr (1.12 SDS), and his BMI was 14.73 (−0.82 SDS).\nThe onset of puberty occurred at 12 years old with normal onset, timing, tempo, and magnitude of pubertal changes []. He stopped rhGH treatment at 16 years and 3 months old when he reached the definitive stature []: his height was 170.8 cm (−0.64 SDS) and his weight was 51.800 kg (−1.56 SDS) with a BMI of 17.76 (−1.63 SDS) (Fig. ).\nAt 17"

Her abdomen was flat and soft, and Virchow’s lymph nodes were not palpable. The patient’s hemoglobin concentration was 6.1 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen concentration was 25.8 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 0.9 ng/mL, and carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9 was 9.6 U/mL. Upper endoscopy showed a type 3 tumor on the lesser curvature side of the gastric angle (Fig. ), and biopsy revealed a group 5, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen showed wall thickening with contrast enhancement on the lesser curvature side of the angular incisure, part of which was in contact with the pancreas. Gastric cancer may have invaded the pancreas because the fat at the border with the pancreas had disappeared. In addition, the lymph nodes on the lesser curvature and the liver hilum were slightly swollen (Fig a and b). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed accumulation only in tumors (SUV max 8.0), but not in lymph nodes or other organs. Based on these findings, the preoperative pathological diagnosis was T4b N1 M0 stage IIIb, and surgery was indicated.\nIntraoperative findings showed no ascites or peritoneal dissemination. However, because gastric cancer had invaded the pancreas, total gastrectomy, splenectomy, and resection of the pancreatic tail were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 18 days after surgery.\nPostoperative pathological examination revealed small disseminated nodules in the resected specimen. The final diagnosis was T4bN3aM1, stage IV, according to the 8th Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM classification []. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, we started combination therapy with S-1 and cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy. S-1 was administered orally at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks in a 5-week cycle, with an intravenous dose of 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on the seventh day of each cycle. The therapeutic effect was judged according to the RECIST guidelines, version 1.1; adverse events were recorded in accordance with CTCAE criteria, version 4.0 [, ]; and no recurrence was observed during the first 6 months of treatment. However, owing to a grade 3 loss of appetite, the patient experienced marked weight loss to 37 kg; therefore, cisplatin administration was discontinued after"

After detailed physical and radiographic examinations, she was diagnosed with Garden type Ⅱ of an intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck (). She was referred to our hospital for further surgical treatment. She had a history of severe mitral regurgitation, mild dementia and chronic constipation. Her current pharmacotherapy includes three constipation medications and verapamil. Unfortunately, further internal medicine information was unavailable. ECG, performed at our emergency department, showed sinus rhythm.\nThe orthopaedic surgeons decided on a less invasive ORIF using cannulated cancellous screws (CCS) because of the minimal displacement of the fracture and advanced age of the patient.\nWe selected FNB and LFCNB under DEX sedation as the anaesthesia method because the planned ORIF required only a small incision. Additionally, to prevent intraoperative or postoperative complications, including hypotension, postoperative delirium (PD) and respiratory failure, and due to suspicion of fused vertebrae for vertebral fracture, GA and NA were avoided.\nDuring the operation, the patient’s blood pressure was monitored non-invasively, along with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and continual skin temperature monitoring. To assess respiratory depression associated with sedation, nasal capnography—handmade with a suction catheter—was used to monitor end-tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate. Sedation level was assessed using the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale.

She measured 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 34.2 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.2 kg/m2. There was profound cachexia. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, or distention. A comprehensive gastrointestinal workup including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, and small bowel series, was unremarkable. Complete blood count was normal. Notable abnormalities on the metabolic panel were the sodium at 129 mEq/L (normal 135 - 148), chloride at 88 mEq/L (normal 96 - 109), and creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL (normal 0.5 - 1.2). The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 154 U/L (normal 0 - 31) and 136 U/L (normal 0 - 31), respectively. The serum bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, glucose, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin and prealbumin were normal. Psychiatry was consulted, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\nThe patient was started on a regular diet on day 1 of hospitalization, with estimated needs of 1,345 - 1,598 calories per day and 40 - 47 g of protein per day. However, given her gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, several tests were pursued which required alterations in her diet during the initial week of hospitalization. For the most part, she was nil per os (NPO) status or ordered for a clear liquid diet while workup was pending until day 8 of hospitalization. Thus, refeeding was determined to have started on day 8 of hospitalization. She was initially ordered a vegan diet per her request, with subsequent liberalization to a regular diet. A calorie count performed on days 14 - 16 of hospitalization revealed she was consuming almost 100% of all food trays. Total parenteral nutrition was discussed early during her hospitalization, given food intolerance and disruptions in oral nutrition; however, it was not pursued. Notably, her weight initially decreased from her admission weight of 34.2 kg to a nadir around 30.8 - 31.0 kg on days 10 - 13 of hospitalization. Her weight began to increase starting day 14 of hospitalization or day 7 of refeeding.\nOn hospitalization day 6 (i.e., before refeeding), the patient’s AST and ALT rose steeply to 671 and 362 U/L, respectively. They peaked at 750 and 638 U/L, respectively, on hospitalization day 10, 2 days after refeeding was initiated (). Additional laboratory workup for the etiology of liver injury (LI) included hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, which were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper were normal. Ferritin and serum iron were mildly elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibody titers were slightly elevated at 1:20 dilution, but this was considered a false positive with negative anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. The immunoglobulin profile was also normal. Acetaminophen levels were undetectable. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was normal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed on hospitalization day 11, 3 days after refeeding; histology revealed mild glycogen depletion, marked ceroid pigment around the central veins, and scattered hepatocellular atrophy (). There was no histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or significant fibrosis.\nThe patient continued to tolerate a regular diet and gain weight during her hospital course. She was eventually transferred to an Eating Disorders Unit for monitoring and treatment. She then started on the nutrition protocol for eating disorders with a slow increase in daily nutrition from 1,500 calories per day to 4,000 calories per day by day 40 of hospitalization. Over the subsequent 2 months, the patient’s weight increased from 34.2 kg (BMI 14.2 kg/m2) to 38.4 kg (BMI 16.0 kg/m2), and her trans"

She showed disturbance of orientation, as revealed by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of E4 V4 M6. She was able to raise both arms, move her legs, and perform facial movements when instructed, showing no clear motor paralysis. Marchiafava-Bignami disease was diagnosed based on the above clinical course and imaging findings. We immediately provided an intravenous infusion to correct her hydration level and administered vitamins.\nOn the 16th day after admission, the patient was transferred to our hospital's convalescence ward where she underwent neuropsychological tests and rehabilitation. By this time, her orientation disturbance had disappeared and she was able to converse smoothly. She required no assistance with activities of daily living inside the hospital. During her hospital stay, she showed no clear callosal dissociation symptoms and made no subjective complaints.\nThe results of a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition [] evaluation performed between the 11th and 15th day of hospital stay showed verbal IQ of 57, performance IQ of 52, full-scale IQ of 51, verbal comprehension of 54, perceptual organization of 55, working memory of 54, and processing speed of 54, indicating an overall reduction in intellectual function.

On admission, her height was 142 cm and she weighed 44.6 kg, such that her body mass index (BMI) was 22.1. The vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.7°C; blood pressure, 119/74 mmHg; pulse rate, 117 beats per minute, regular and respiratory rate, 18 per minute. Physical examination revealed no distinct findings or signs of meningeal irritation. Detailed examination revealed multiple clusters of erythematous vesicles arranged in a left sacral (S2 and S3) dermatomal pattern. The patient had experienced only a slight tingling sensation in relation to these lesions and insisted that they were not painful. The physical examination findings were otherwise normal with the exception of an abnormal vibratory sensation in the bilateral lower extremities. Hematological findings were as follows: hematocrit, 41.7%; hemoglobin, 13.7 g/dL; white blood cells, 7,100/mm3 (neutrophils, 79.0%; eosinophils, 0%; basophils, 0.1%; monocytes, 1.9%; lymphocytes, 19.0%; no atypical lymphocytes) and platelets, 169,000/mm3. Serum biochemistry, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and urine test results, were normal. The chest X-ray examination, abdominal computed tomography (CT) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities. Enhanced lumbar MRI detected no disorders possibly responsible for the bladder and rectal disturbance. The laboratory and radiological examinations yielded no findings supporting a diagnosis of vascular disorders, sarcoidosis, malignant lymphoma or other neoplasm. Intramedullary lesions indicating myelitis were not detected on MRI.\nBased on the clinical diagnosis of HZ, intravenous acyclovir at a dose of 750 mg every 8 hours was started on admittance with urinary catheterization. In view of the presence of obstructive uropathy and constipation with HZ, suggestive of ES, a lumbar puncture was performed on the 4th day of hospitalization. The CSF was clear without xanthochromia. The CSF cells were recorded as 69/μL (mono-nuclear cells, 98.6%; polynuclear cells, 1.4%), and protein was elevated (46 mg/dL). The CSF glucose level (104 mg/dL) was relatively decreased, with a high serum glucose level (319 mg/dL). Gram staining of the CSF was negative for microorganisms. CSF, blood and urine cultures were negative. Aseptic meningitis was therefore diagnosed, the cause of which was confirmed based on a positive CSF PCR reaction for VZV-DNA. The acyclovir dosage was increased to 1.5 g every 8 hours, which was continuously administered for 14 days, accompanied by methylprednisolone pulse therapy for 3 days. Oral prednisolone was administered and then gradually tapered. Her blood glucose level was controlled with intensive insulin therapy. Severe constipation which had been difficult to control with various combinations of several laxatives gradually improved after the 8th hospital day. Urinary retention also showed improvement, and the bladder catheter was removed on the 18th hospital day. A urodynamic study performed on the 21st hospital day revealed no abnormalities.

Her total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) were 323 mg/dL, 349 mg/dL, 59 mg/dL, and 203 mg/dL, respectively. Her fasting glucose level was 183 mg/dL, fasting insulin level was 4.81 μIU/mL, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was 2.17. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.9%, and the patient was receiving treatment constituting 14 units of insulin detemir plus 1,000 mg of metformin for blood glucose control.\nIn the 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, her serum cortisol level was 24.6 μg/dL and was not suppressed to less than 2 μg/dL. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration was 1.59 pg/mL (reference range: 10–60 pg/mL) and was lower than the normal range. Abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed to identify the cause of ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome and revealed a 3.8 cm homogenous enhancing mass in the left adrenal gland (). Levels of other hormones including 24-hour urine metanephrine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, vanillylmandelic acid, 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity were within normal ranges. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome due to a left adrenal adenoma.\nLaparoscopic left adrenal gland removal was performed 2 weeks after diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome. The pathologic finding was cortical adenoma in the left adrenal gland. After left adrenalectomy, the patient’s metabolic abnormalities improved, especially those indicating glucose and lipid metabolism (). Her blood glucose level rapidly decreased compared to preoperative blood glucose level, and we stopped her insulin therapy 2 weeks after surgery. Over 3 months, the patient’s HbA1c level improved from 8.9% to 7.0% despite the use of prednisolone 7.5 mg daily as steroid replacement therapy. Fifteen months after surgery, the patient stopped all oral glucose-lowering agents. Thereafter, oral steroid agent therapy was successfully discontinued, and plasma ACTH recovered to the normal range. At that time, the patient’s body weight was 52 kg, or about 10 kg less than before left adrenalectomy. Her BM"

She had a surgical pulmonary valve replacement with a 25 mm Sorin Mitroflow valve in 2012 (Sorin Group USA Inc, Arvada, Colorado). Routine surveillance TTE revealed significant stenosis of the bio-prosthetic valve with a peak instantaneous gradient of 90 mm Hg. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a severely dilated right ventricle (RV) with indexed end diastolic volume of 180 ml/m<sup>2</sup> and low normal systolic function (ejection fraction of 44%). Moderate regurgitation of the pulmonary valve bio-prosthesis was visualized (25% regurgitation fraction). There was congenital interruption of the inferior caval vein with drainage via azygous continuation to the superior caval vein. The coronary arteries were not well visualized. After discussion at a multi-disciplinary meeting, the patient was accepted for PPVI.\nPrior to the procedure, her MRI scan was imported and manipulated on a dedicated workstation (VesselNavigator, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) to highlight the target structures ().\nUnder general anesthesia, an 8-Fr sheath was introduced into the right internal jugular vein. Stored fluoroscopic images in two projections were used for direct fusion of 2D fluoroscopy and 3D reconstruction (2D–3D registration, ) [, ]. A soft wire in the aorta together with a diagnostic catheter in the superior caval vein and the radiopaque ring of the bio-prosthesis served as references for alignment of the 3D reconstruction. A right heart hemodynamic evaluation, guided by the aligned 3D roadmap, confirmed the noninvasive imaging findings with near systemic RV pressure and a 50 mm Hg peak-to-peak gradient across the bio-prosthesis. After introduction of an Amplatz 0.035” Superstiff (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) wire to the left lower pulmonary artery, a 22 mm Atlas Gold balloon (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc, Tempe, Arizona) was positioned across the bio-prosthetic valve. The balloon was inflated to 12 atm, and 3DRA was performed with simultaneous contrast injection in the left coronary artery (LCA) (). After analysis of the rotational image and post-processing to generate multi-planar reformats and 3D reconstruction, we determined that there was a safe distance between the LCA and the pulmonary bio-prosthesis. We did not feel that there was enough space to break the valve ring to place a larger valve without potentially compromising the LCA [].\nThe decision was made to proceed with valve-in-valve implantation of a 23 mm Edwards Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine California). Over a 0.035” Lunderquist wire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) a 22-Fr, 30 cm Gore DrySeal sheath (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) was fed via the right jugular vein and across the RV and bioprosthetic valve. The valve was then crimped onto an Edwards Certitude delivery system, advanced without difficulty through the DrySeal sheath, then deployed in a satisfactory position within the bioprosthetic valve ring ().\nRepeat hemodynamics demonstrated only a 7 mm Hg gradient across the valve with a RV pressure of < 1/3 systemic. The delivery system was removed and the DrySeal sheath pulled back to the right atrium.\nIntra-cardiac echocardiography (Acuson AcuNav, Siemens Healthcare, San Jose, California) was performed via the DrySeal sheath, showing no pulmonary regurgitation with maximum velocity of flow across the valve of 1.8 m/s () and no evidence of tricuspid valve damage.

The cemented acetabular bipolar cup prevents a dislocation to a certain extent per se and contributes to total hip stability. The gluteus muscles were detached and retracted with a bone flake using a lateral approach, whereas a subvastus approach was performed for surgical exposure of the proximal femur. The acetabulum was first addressed, and an acetabular reinforcement ring with cemented Ecofit cup was implanted with correct alignment. Due to the poor bone quality, we reinforced the acetabular component with screws ( and ). The proximal femur showed intramedullary ossification which required preparation with a chisel and a drill to prepare the medullary cavity for further stem implantation. In this special case, we could reduce the risk of dislocation using an Ecofit cup in combination with an appropriate torsion of the stem. Thus, the Wagner stem was implanted with more anteversion to reduce posterior luxation. In addition, the abductor muscle group was sutured to an applied attachment tube (Implant cast GmbH, Germany) based on the concept of tumorprosthesis providing adequate re-attachment of the bone flake with the gluteal muscles. The surgery was performed by the senior author (AMN). The patient was mobilized with weight bearing of 15kg and a flexion limit of 60° for 6 weeks after surgery. The wound healing period proceeded without any complications although type II collagen is important in early wound healing and known to be compromised by a mutation in the COL2A1 gene. This finding corresponds with another study about head and neck surgery in patients with Kniest dysplasia with no impaired wound healing []. Follow-up showed flexion of the hip up to 90° at 7 weeks after surgery. Weight-bearingwas increased to 30 kg and flexion was limited to 70° at sitting position. Weight-"

The remaining small bowel was 160 cm in length.\nAt the time of ER admission, an initial nutritional assessment was conducted. He was moderately malnourished based on the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) malnutrition criteria []. His estimated nutritional need was 25–30 kcal/kg usual body weight (UBW)/day with 1.2–2.0 g protein/kg UBW/day based on guidelines for the adult critically ill patient []. Because of the mechanical ileus, total PN was initiated with a target of 25 kcal/kg UBW/day and 1.4 g protein/kg UBW/day. PN was customized to prevent the development of electrolyte imbalances.\nAfter extensive small bowel resection, the estimated energy requirement was 1,500 kcal/day (derived using the Penn State equation). In order to decrease stomal output and allow persistent luminal stimulation, continuous tube feeding with a low-residual formula (500 kcal) was initiated at 20 mL/hr over 24 hours. When he could tolerate 1,200 kcal/day at 50 mL/hr over 24 hours, he was weaned off PN (1,058 kcal/day, protein 58 g/day). According to evaluations about 1 month after surgery (postoperative day [POD] #30), he had continued to lose weight; he weighed 41.1 kg (body mass index [BMI] 13.9 kg/m2) which meant he had lost 21.6% of his body weight at admission. HOS (about 3,000 ml/day) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (24.0 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) were observed, so the risk of dehydration was high. Although on POD #30 magnesium concentration was not measured, it was 1.5 mEq/dL on POD #14, and since it was the marginal level and PN was suspended, deficiency of micronutrient was also expected. Intake via tube feeding was 1,400 kcal/day (34 kcal/kg current body weight [CBW]) and protein 56 g/day (1.35 g/kg CBW). Our NST decided to increase the enteral nutrition (EN) supply to the target calorie level and to provide supplemental PN (commercial 3-in-1 PN with multivitamins and trace elements, 345 kcal/day, protein 16 g/day) to replenish nutrients lost. Total amount supplied, including EN and PN, was 1845 kcal/day (45 kcal/kg CBW) and protein 75.8 g/day (1.85 g/kg CBW).\nHe commenced an oral diet 6 weeks after operation (POD #43) and was again weaned from PN. A dietitian evaluated dietary intake, and assessed stomal output volume and consistency. The estimated dietary intake was 1400 kcal/day with protein 80 g/day. The stomal output was approximately 3,000 mL/day (the bag was emptied 10 times/day) of watery diarrhea. The dietitian educated the patient on the need for frequent small meals, the sipping of fluid between meals (thus not with meals) to ensure hydration, and the avoidance of foods containing high levels of fiber and sugary beverages, which might exacerbate stomal output. Multivitamins and multiminerals were recommended. As a typical Korean meal includes a bowl of vegetable soup and several vegetable side dishes, the need to strictly avoid soup and vegetables was emphasized. The guidelines recommend commencing vegetables 6–8 weeks after operation. However, given his HOS status, a vegetable-free diet was maintained until the stomal output fell to below 2,000 mL/day, even 8 weeks after the operation. To enhance compliance and to help him understand the principles of food selection, the dietitian visited him 4 times.\nAs discharge approached, the dietitian conducted a nutritional re-assessment. The patient exhibited severe malnutrition based on the ASPEN/AND criteria []. He had lost 25.4% of his body weight and exhibited moderate loss of muscle mass and body fat. His estimated nutritional requirements were 35–45 kcal/kg UBW/day and 1.5–2.0 g protein/kg UBW/day. He was taking 1,800 kcal and 90 g protein/day but still losing weight. To increase his weight and improve his nutritional status, home PN support was recommended. The NST planned home PN three times/week (commercial 3-in-1 PN with multivitamins and trace elements, 578 kcal, protein 26 g).\nWhen he was re-admitted 1 month after discharge (POD #106), nutritional re-assessment was performed. His percent of ideal body weight value was 71.6%, his BMI was 15.8 kg/m2, and the nutritional intake met his requirements; his nutritional status had improved compared to that 1 month earlier. His progress is summarized in .\nThe energy intakes from both EN and PN after loop ileostomy are shown in . Two months after operation (POD #60), his body weight was 40.3 kg at discharge. He maintained the oral intake that he had established in the hospital, and received home PN, for 2 months after discharge. About 18 weeks after the operation (POD #106), he was re-admitted to manage necrosis of both feet and hands associated with use of an inotropic agent in the intensive care unit. His body weight was 46.6 kg (BMI 15.8 kg/m2), and had thus increased by 15.6% since dis"

His blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, and ha had pulse rate of 70 beats/min.\nUpon physical examination, he was found to be myxedematous with coarse facial features including dry and thickened skin. However, no goiter was found. His weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were 68.5 kg (90-95 percentile), 155 cm (50th percentile), and 28.5 kg/m2 (>97th percentile), respectively. Pubertal development was also noted (penis, Tanner stage 2-3; pubic hair, Tanner stage 1; testis, 6-8 mL). Ophthalmological examinations, including a visual field test, revealed no abnormal findings.\nLaboratory data revealed normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dL), and increased aspartate transaminase (68 IU/L), and alanine transaminase (139 IU/L), hypercholesteremia (total cholesterol, 378 mg/dL), hypertriglycemia (409 mg/dL), and increased creatine kinase (912.2 IU/L) levels (). Endocrinological testing showed severe primary hypothyroidism, elevated thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH>100 µIU/mL) (normal range, 0.5 to 4.8 µIU/mL), decreased total thyroxine level (1.04 µg/dL) (4.5 to 12.0 µg/dL), decreased total triiodothyronine level (0.31 ng/mL) (1.19 to 2.18 ng/mL) and decreased free thyroxine level (0.07 ng/dL) (0.8 to 2.3 ng/dL), In addition, elevated levels of serum antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (1,933.39 IU/mL) (<10 IU/mL), antithyroglobulin antibodes (848.16 IU/mL) (<100 IU/mL), and TSH receptor antibodies (immunoassay>40 IU/L) (0.3 to 1.22 IU/L) were found. The results of the bioassay were negative for TSH receptor stimulating antibodies ().\nAdditional results of the laboratory analysis are as follows: prolactin, 29.04 ng/mL (3 to 18 ng/mL); morning serum cortisol, 6.69 µg/dL (3 to 21 µg/dL); adrenocorticotropic hormone, 20.31 pg/mL (10 to 60 pg/mL); growth hormone, 0.08 ng/mL (0.07 to 5.68 ng/mL); insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), 105.0 ng/mL (145.2 to 647.8 ng/mL); IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), 3,270 ng/mL (2,200 to 4,490 ng/mL); luteinizing hormone, 1.32 mIU/mL (0.2 to 4.9 mIU/mL); follicle stimulating hormone, 4.29 mIU/mL (1.8 to 3.2 mIU/mL); and testosterone, 0.2 ng/mL (0.18 to 1.5 ng/mL) (). According to the Greulich-Pyle method, bone age was 12.5 years (chronological age, 13 years). Thyroid sonography revealed a heterogenous internal structure; neither the size nor the vascularity of the bilateral gland was increased (). Thyroid scintigraphy with 99mTc revealed a substantially decreased uptake in both lobes (). Magnetic resonance images displayed an enlarged pituitary gland, with upward convexity, measuring 13.0 mm in height and a transverse diameter of 8 mm ().\nAfter L-thyroxin treatment was initiated, the symptoms of facial palsy and the patient's clinical condition improved (, ). After 3 months, the second magnetic resonance images revealed a regression of the pituitary hyperplasia and a smaller pituitary gland than that from the first round of images. This condition was described as reactive hyperplasia caused by primary hypothyroidism. After 8 months, follow-up thyroid sonography revealed that the parenchymal echogenicity was coarse, and had decreased in size. However, changes to the size or echogenicity of the thyroid gland were not significant.\nAfter 1 year, the patient's height was 166.2 cm (50-75th percentile), which is an 11 cm gain in height and his weight was 66 kg (75-90th percentile).

Physical examination showed a temperature of 38°C and epigastric tenderness. Laboratory data were consistent with an inflammatory reaction (white blood cell count 11,700/μl, C-reactive protein 7.93 mg/dl), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 1.9 g/dl) and coagulopathy (prothrombin time 57.9%, activated partial thromboplastin time 47.7 s). Tumor markers were within normal limits (CEA 1.2 ng/ml, CA19-9 4 U/ml).\nAbdominal CT scan revealed inflammatory thickening of the transverse colon and a colo-duodenal fistula at the hepatic flexure (fig. ). Endoscopy showed a fistula in the duodenum and a dilated stomach filled with refluxed stool. A colo-duodenal fistula between the lower duodenal angle and the hepatic flexure was demonstrated by contrast X-ray during endoscopy (fig. ). The patient was admitted to the gastroenterology service and treated with antibiotics, no oral intake and intravenous hyperalimentation. The central venous catheter was removed soon after placement because of continuous fever, and her nutritional status did not improve. The fever persisted for 2 weeks despite routine management and she was referred for surgical treatment of the inflammatory lesion in the transverse colon.\nRight hemi-colectomy with resection of the fistula was considered too invasive given her poor overall health as illustrated by hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. A temporary ileostomy was planned to reduce the amount of refluxed stool in the duodenum, with a gastrostomy for drainage. Ileostomy was made using a small incision under general anesthesia, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed at the same time. The ileostomy was created 20 cm from the cecum. After percutaneous gastropexy using a Funada-style kit, endoscopic gastrostomy was performed using the direct method (Direct Ideal PEG, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three days later, the gastrostomy button was changed to a double lumen gastro-jejunostomy tube (MIC-TJ, Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, Ga., USA) using a small-caliber endoscope and a guide wire. The tube was advanced to the jejunum and elemental diet given through the distal lumen of the tube. Gastric contents with refluxed stool were drained from the proximal lumen. Colonoscopy was performed on postoperative day 21, which showed a tight stenosis of the transverse colon. A colo-colonic fistula was revealed near the stenosis by contrast X-ray during colonoscopy.\n68 days later, the patient's nutritional status and general condition had improved (serum albumin 3.3 g/dl, prothrombin time 81.4%, body weight 51 kg), and a right hemi-colectomy with resection of the fistula "

His abdomen was moderately distended, firm to palpation with diffuse tenderness, and had palpable hard fecal masses in the suprapubic area and bilateral lower quadrants. He had mild bilateral non-pitting pedal edema. Perianal inspection revealed oozing, liquid brown stool with no skin tags. A digital rectal examination revealed a large, hard ball of stool impacted in the distal rectum. Inguinal lymphadenopathy and scrotal edema were absent. An abdominal radiograph demonstrated a large stool burden causing rectal dilation of 10 cm with distention of the sigmoid colon extending upwards to the level of the umbilicus (). Laboratory testing revealed the following results which were all within normal limits: sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL, creatinine 0.61 mg/dL, and glucose 91 mg/dL. His complete blood cell count, thyroid function studies, tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA were normal. He was given a parenteral normal saline bolus for rehydration. Within thirty minutes of the fluid bolus, he developed worsening pedal edema and overlying erythema spreading upwards from his feet to his knees. Due to a concern for deep venous thrombosis, a Duplex Ultrasound was performed; it did not reveal a thrombus, but showed changes in the waveforms in his common femoral and external iliac veins bilaterally, indicating pelvic venous compression (). D-dimer and coagulation studies were obtained and were within normal limits. The pediatric surgeons performed a manual disimpaction under general anesthesia due to his worsening clinical status. A three-digit rectal examination encountered perineal edema and a large fecal impaction, which was manually removed with abdominal compression and transanal disruption. Nine liters of crystalloid solution were given in serial irrigations and resulted in multiple stool masses being removed. Over the next three days, his bowel was sufficiently cleaned out with sixteen liters of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes infused via a nasogastric tube. A repeat abdominal radiograph confirmed a significant reduction in the stool burden and decompression of his entire colon. His pedal and perineal edema resolved, and he was discharged on maintenance polyethylene glycol 3350 solution 17 gm twice daily and Bisacodyl 10 mg tablet once daily.\nOne week later he had a barium enema which showed a posterior rectal shelf along with a change in caliber of the distal rectum with spiculations. These findings created concern for decreased colonic motility. Four months after discharge, he continued to have soft daily bowel movements with compliance to maintenance laxative therapy. The pedal and perineal edema had resolved. He had a good appetite and denied abdominal discomfort. Serial clinical examinations at two follow up visits did not reveal recurrence of palpable mass per abdomen. An abdominal radiograph one month later demonstrated minimal residual stool, and a repeat Doppler ultrasound showed normal venous waveforms (). Hence, imaging studies for evaluating other causes of extrinsic venous compression were not pursued. Further investigation of the etiology of the constipation, including a rectal biopsy and anorectal and colonic manometry, were deferred at this time due to the resolution of the constipation. Subsequent annual visits to his pediatrician’s office found him to be adhering to a higher fiber diet, daily laxative as prescribed, with no reported difficulty in stooling and steady growth. His weight had gone up to 70.5 kg at 14 years of age and to 81.4 kg at 15 years of age."

There were bilateral edema of the lower extremities.\nLaboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 4,600/μl, a red blood cell count of 3.71×106/μl, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dl, and platelet count of 21.3×104/μl. In addition, total protein was 6.3 g/dl, albumin was 2.4 g/dl, serum urea nitrogen was 26 mg/dl, serum Cre was 1.55 mg/dl, C-reactive protein was 1.6 mg/dl, and lactate dehydrogenase was 257 IU/l (normal: 119-229 IU/l). Immunological tests showed that antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and U1-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibody were all negative. IgG was 1,340 mg/dl, IgA was 427 g/dl, and IgM was 266 mg/dl. The serum level of C3 was 123 mg/dl (normal: >86 mg/dl), C4 was 19 mg/dl (normal: >18 mg/dl), and CH50 was 38 U/ml (normal: >30 U/ml). The patient was negative for hepatitis B virus antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, and Treponema antigen. Urinary protein excretion was 9.1 g/day, and the sediment contained 5-10 erythrocytes per high-power field. Urinary Bence Jones protein was negative by immunofixation electrophoresis.\nNo findings suggestive of malignancy were revealed by imaging studies such as computed tomography and ultrasonography. The long axis of the kidney was calculated to be 9.0 cm bilaterally. Serum anti-PLA2R autoantibody was positive according to the method of Akiyama et al. []. Renal biopsy was done to evaluate the renal changes in this patient.\nLight microscopy of a renal biopsy specimen containing 36 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in 22 of them (fig. ). The other 13 glomeruli showed mild mesangial matrix expansion (fig. ), but there was no definite spike formation, bubbling, or thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (fig. ). In the tubulointerstitial region, atrophy or fibrosis affected 50-60% of the cortical tissue (fig. ). The arterioles displayed mild to moderate hyalinosis (fig. ), while the interlobular arteries showed mild to moderate fibroelastic intimal thickening (fig. ). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the GBM. Analysis of IgG subclasses revealed dominant staining for IgG4 (IgG4 > IgG1 > IgG3 > IgG2; fig. ), while staining for IgA and IgM was very weak. The anti-PLA2R binding in the biopsy was positive. Congo red staining was negative. Electron microscopy showed subepithelial electron-dense deposits (EDD) in the GBM, but these subepithelial EDD were not associated with spike-like protrusions arising from the basement membrane (fig. ). Stage 1 MGN was diagnosed due to these findings.\nAnasarca was treated with diuretics (furosemide at 80 mg daily) and dietary restriction (6 g of salt and 700 ml of water daily), achieving weight loss from 56.4 to 51.0 kg. Because the patient did not want steroid therapy due to adverse effects such as bone disease, cyclosporin microemulsion (Neoral at 50 mg daily) was added, and the level at 2 h after administration was titrated in the range of 600-1,000 ng/ml. However, proteinuria persisted, and renal function deteriorated rapidly. Hemodialysis was started when Cre was 6.0 mg/dl and urea nitrogen was 102 mg/dl because of exacerbation of pleural effusion and generalized edema along with an increase in weight to 58 kg at 2 months after diagnosis."

Her respiratory rate was 36 cycles per minute but lung fields were clinically clear. The abdomen was grossly distended with Bandl’s ring and symphysio-fundal height of 41 cm. There was generalized tenderness with crepitus and guarding over the anterior abdominal wall. Fetal parts were freely felt; singleton fetus, longitudinal lie, and cephalic presentation with a descent of 3/5th. Fetal heart sounds were absent. Pelvic examination revealed a foul smelling, blood stained vulva, and vagina. There was a glaring gishiri cut. The cervix was edematous but fully dilated with offensive watery discharge. There was marked carput formation and pelvic assessment affirmed an inadequate pelvis. An indwelling urethral catheter we passed drained scanty bloody urine.

Furthermore, body mass index (BMI) was 27.6 kg/m2 (95-97th percentile). Both rhizomelic and mesomelic limb shortness and terminal phalanges of fingers shortness were present. He had a flat and round face with midface hypoplasia, a broad flat nose, a thin upper lip with post operation scar. Brown scales covered the extremities, trunk, neck, preauricular areas (). He had not yet attained puberty as he exhibited; absence of pubic hair, small penis and scrotal sac. Laboratory findings were shown as follows: hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 7,900/µL, platelet 338,000/µL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 61 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 85 IU/L, total cholesterol 271 mg/dL, triglyceride 244 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 200.7 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 53.7 mg/dL. There was no elevation in Luteinizing hormone (0.1 mIU/mL), Follicle stimulating hormone (0.46 mIU/mL) and Testosterone (0.1 ng/mL). Prepubertal response was observed in a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test. Radiographs showed shortness of the long bones, bowed radii, and Madelung deformity of forearms (). Bone age (Greulich-Pyle method) was 13-14 yr at the chronological age of 13.5 yr. Brain MRI revealed almost hypoplastic olfactory bulb with an ill-defined olfactory tract and sulci. Abdominal US revealed a fatty liver. He had hyposmia which was tested by using serial dilutions of multiple odorants. He had impaired vision with nystagmus. Ophthalmological examination disclosed iris transillumination demonstrating defects in the iris pigment epithelium (), hypopigmentation of the fundus, and macular hypoplasia in both eyes (). Wearing tinted glasses with correction of myopic astigmatism and a hat was recommended in order to reduce the risk of exposure to sunlight. Psychometric evaluation showed a total IQ of 52 (WISC-R) indicating mild mental retardation. Also, he was impulsive, exhibited hyperactive behavior including poor attention. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a terminal deletion of Xp; 46,Y,del(X)(p22.2). To specify the breakpoint, high resolution microarray analysis performed. We analyzed the genomic DNA on the Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M array, which provides whole genome coverage with a high density of 2.7 million markers. This array contains approximately 400,000 SNP markers and 2.3 million non-polymorphic markers, with high density coverage across cytogenetically significant regions. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using QIAamp DNA mini kit DNA Isolation Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The microarray assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols () (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Data was collected using GeneChipÒ Scanner 3000 and CEL Files were analyzed using Affymetrix Chromosome analysis Suite software (ChAS v.1.1). The results revealed a terminal 9.7 Mb deletion at Xp22.2 resulting in the absence of genes from the telomere of Xp to GPR143 of Xp22 ().\nAt 14.5 yr, his height was 125.7 cm. This showed a gain of 2 cm for 1 yr. But the growth hormone provocation test showed no deficiency of growth hormone. In addition, he did not show any pubertal change, thus we began a monthy injection of testosterone enanthate at a dosage of 50 mg increasing the dosage by 50% every 6 months. At 16.3 yr, his height was 134.4 cm. This demonstrated a gain of 8.7 cm for 1.75 yr. However, he didn't take any medications nor follow any recommended diet for his fatty liver and hyperlipidemia, and he also stopped visiting our clinic. At 18 yr, he visited again. His height was 135.5 cm (< 3 rd percentile), his weight was 61 kg (25-50th percentile), and his body mass index (BMI) was 33.2 kg/m2 (> 97th percentile). Laboratory findings were shown as follows: Fasting glucose 118 mg/dL, HbA1C 7%, AST 165 IU/L, ALT 152 IU/L, total cholesterol 287 mg/dL, triglyceride 560 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol 189.8 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol 40.0 mg/dL, Luteinizing hormone 0.17 mIU/mL, Follicle stimulating hormone 0.15 mIU/mL, Testosterone 0.2 ng/mL. In addition to his previous diseases, he was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.\nNext, his sister was 11 yr old. Her personal physical characteristics are as follows: Height was 126 cm (3rd percentile), Weight 40 kg (70th percentile), Body mass index (BMI) 25.2 kg/m2 (>97th percentile). Both rhizomelic and mesomelic limb shortness were present (). She showed breast development, but no icthyosis. She had normal vision with myopia, showed slightly hypopigmented retina. Laboratory tests revealed hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 232 mg/dL), the remaining serum electrolytes and complete blood cell counts were normal. Radiological examination of the forearms and wrists confirmed Madelung deformity with lateral and dorsal bowing of the radius and ulna, distal ulna dislocation, and shortness of the long bones (). Bone age was 11-12 yr at the chronological age of 11 yr. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46,X,del(X)(p22.2). Microarry analysis revealed same with the brother's. We bgan a growth hormone therapy (Eutropin 1.0 IU/kg/week). At 12.5 yr old, Menarche was observed. At 14 yr old, her final height was 143 cm.
